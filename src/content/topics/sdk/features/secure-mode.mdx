## Overview

This topic explains how to use the secure mode feature to safely evaluate feature flags in your web browser.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Newer versions of LaunchDarkly SDKs replace users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. To learn more, read [Contexts](/home/contexts).

Creating contexts and evaluating flags based on them is supported in the latest major versions of [some of our SDKs](/sdk). For these SDKs, the code samples on this page include the two most recent versions.

You can upgrade your SDKs at any time, but the ability to target by context, or review context instances that have encountered flags in your application, is only available for customers in the contexts Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access to this feature, [join the EAP](https://launchdarkly.com/eap).

If you are using the latest version of an SDK and are not part of the EAP, your application can send contexts to LaunchDarkly and they will appear on the **Users** list.

## Using secure mode

Secure mode ensures that customers' feature flag evaluations are kept private in web browser environments, and that one end user cannot inspect the variations for another end user. On an insecure device, a malicious end user could use a context or user key to identify what flag values another end user receives by analyzing the results of multiple flag evaluations. Secure mode prevents you from doing an evaluation for a context or user key that hasn't been signed on the backend.

Secure mode is only available for communication between client-side SDKs and LaunchDarkly. It is not necessary for server-side SDKs.

### Understanding how secure mode works

Secure mode works by having you configure your JavaScript SDK to include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your context or user key. This hash is signed with the SDK key for your environment.

To use secure mode, you must complete the following:

* **Enable secure mode for each environment.** You can enable secure mode for each of your environments on the **Environments** tab of your project on the [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects) page. Secure mode is an environment-wide setting. You can enable secure mode for your environment even if you're also using mobile SDKs that don't support it. Enabling secure mode does not cause those SDKs to fail.

* **Compute the secure mode hash.** Enabling secure mode means that every request coming from a client-side JavaScript SDK requires the secure mode hash to evaluate flag variations. You can pass this to your front-end code with the mechanism of your choice, such as bootstrapping or as a template variable.

  Each of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash for a key. To learn how, read [Generating a secure mode hash](#generating-a-secure-mode-hash). Alternatively, you can compute the hash yourself. To learn how, read [Computing the hash manually](#computing-the-hash-manually).

* **Send the computed secure mode hash for the context or user.** You need to include this when requesting flag evaluations. To learn how, read [Configuring secure mode in the JavaScript client-side SDK](#configuring-secure-mode-in-the-javascript-client-side-sdk).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Enable secure mode during initial setup</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can enable secure mode at any time when you use LaunchDarkly SDKs. As a best practice, we recommend that you enable secure mode during initial SDK configuration, because late-stage changes to your SDK configuration may have negative interactions with other settings.

## Computing the hash manually

To compute the hash manually, locate the server-side SDK key for your environment on the **Environments** tab of your project on the **Account settings** page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of the UTF-8 encoding of your context key, using the UTF-8 encoding of your SDK key as a secret, and convert the hash to a hexadecimal string.

Here is a .NET (server-side) example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

var encoding = new UTF8Encoding();
var keyBytes = encoding.GetBytes("sdk-key-123abc");
var hmacSha256 = new HMACSHA256(keyBytes);
var hashBytes = hmacSha256.ComputeHash(encoding.GetBytes("context-key-123abc"));
var hashString = BitConverter.ToString(hashBytes).Replace("-", "").ToLower();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Configuring secure mode in the JavaScript client-side SDK

You should send the computed secure mode hash for your user as the [`hash` attribute](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDOptions.html#hash) in the `LDOptions` object during client initialization and as the [`hash` parameter](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDClient.html#identify) if subsequently identifying new contexts:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v3.0">

```js
// JavaScript SDK v3.0
// client initialization
const client = LDClient.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', context, options = {
  hash: 'server-generated-hash-123abc'
});

// identification of new contexts
client.identify(newContext, hash, function() {
  console.log("New context's flags available");
});
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v3.0 (TypeScript)">

```ts
// JavaScript SDK v3.0 (TypeScript)
// client initialization
const context: ld.LDContext = { kind: 'user', key: 'context-key-123abc' };
const options: ld.LDOptions = { hash: 'server-generated-hash-123abc' };
const client: ld.LDClient = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', context, options);

// identification of new contexts
client.identify(newContext, hash, function () {
  console.log("New context's flags available");
});

```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v2.x">

```js
// JavaScript SDK v2.x
// client initialization
const client = LDClient.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', user, options = {
  hash: 'server-generated-hash-123abc'
});

// identification of new user contexts
client.identify(newUser, hash, function() {
  console.log("New user's flags available");
});
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v2.x (TypeScript)">

```ts
// JavaScript SDK v2.x (TypeScript)
// client initialization
const user: ld.LDUser = { key: 'user-key-123abc' };
const options: ld.LDOptions = { hash: 'server-generated-hash-123abc' };
const client: ld.LDClient = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', user, options);

// identification of new user contexts
client.identify(newUser, hash, function () {
  console.log("New user's flags available");
});

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To use secure mode, context objects must contain a predefined `key` attribute. Secure mode is not compatible with the SDK's ability to [automatically generate keys for anonymous contexts](/sdk/features/user-context-config#anonymous-contexts-in-the-javascript-sdk) because the SDK needs a correctly calculated `hash` value.
