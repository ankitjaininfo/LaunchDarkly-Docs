## Overview

This topic explains how to send `custom` events using the track feature in your SDK. The track feature is available on both client-side and server-side SDKs.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Newer versions of LaunchDarkly SDKs replace users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. To learn more, read [Contexts](/home/contexts).

Creating contexts and evaluating flags based on them is supported in the latest major versions of [some of our SDKs](/sdk). For these SDKs, the code samples on this page include the two most recent versions.

You can upgrade your SDKs at any time, but the ability to target by context, or review context instances that have encountered flags in your application, is only available for customers in the contexts Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access to this feature, [join the EAP](https://launchdarkly.com/eap).

If you are using the latest version of an SDK and are not part of the EAP, your application can send contexts to LaunchDarkly and they will appear on the **Users** list.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Tracking events

The track feature lets you record actions your customers take in your application as events. You can connect these events to metrics in experiments in the flags list. To learn more about the events SDKs send to LaunchDarkly, read [Analytics events](/sdk/concepts/events).

You can view events in the **Debugger** page.

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

### .NET (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (client-side) code sample">

The `Track` method lets you record actions your users take on your site. This lets you record events that take place on your server.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
client.Track("metric-key-123abc");
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also attach custom data to your event by passing an extra parameter to `Track`, using the `LdValue` class to represent any value that can be encoded in JSON. To learn how, read [`LdClient.Track`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-client-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Client.LdClient.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Client_LdClient_Track_System_String_LaunchDarkly_Sdk_LdValue_).
</Details>

### Android

<Details summary="Expand Android code sample">

The `track` method lets you record actions your end users take in your application. You can also attach custom JSON data to your event by passing an extra `JsonElement` parameter to `track`.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java">

```java
client.track("metric-key-123abc", data);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
client.track("metric-key-123abc", data)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn more, read [`track`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/android-client-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/android/LDClientInterface.html#track-java.lang.String-).

You can also attach custom data to your event by calling [`TrackData`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/android-client-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/android/LDClientInterface.html#trackData-java.lang.String-com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDValue-) or [`TrackMetric`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/android-client-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/android/LDClientInterface.html#trackMetric-java.lang.String-com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDValue-double-).

</Details>

### C/C++ (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand C/C++ (client-side) code sample">

The `track` method allows you to record `custom` events in your application with LaunchDarkly:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c

</Details>

### Electron

<Details summary="Expand Electron code sample">

Evaluating flags, either with `variation()` or with `allFlags()`, produces analytics events which you can observe on your LaunchDarkly **Debugger** page. The initial user you specify in the client constructor, as well as any user you specify with `identify()`, produces an analytics event which is how LaunchDarkly receives your user data.

You can also explicitly send an event with any data you like using the `track` function:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
client.track('my-custom-event-key', { customProperty: someValue });
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

</Details>

### Flutter

<Details summary="Expand Flutter code sample">

The `track` method lets you record actions your users take in your you do application. You can have also attach custom JSON data to your event by passing an extra `LDValue` parameter to `track`.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Dart">

```dart
await LDClient.track('metric-key-123abc', data: LDValue.objectBuilder().addBool("clicked-button", true).build());
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also attach custom data to your event using the [track method](https://launchdarkly.github.io/flutter-client-sdk/launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk/LDClient/track.html) with optional parameters.
</Details>

### iOS

<Details summary="Expand iOS code sample">

In the iOS SDK, `track` is a `custom` event added to the LDClient event store. A client app can set a tracking event to allow client customized data analysis. After an app has called `track`, the app cannot remove the event from the event store. LDClient periodically transmits events to LaunchDarkly based on the frequency set in `LDConfig.eventFlushInterval`. The LDClient must be started and online.

After the SDK's event store is full, the SDK discards new events until the event store is cleared when it reports events to LaunchDarkly. Configure the size of the event store using `LDConfig.eventCapacity`. The first parameter, `key`, is the key for the event. The SDK does nothing with the key, which can be any string the client app sends. The second parameter, `data`, is the data for the event. The `data` parameter is optional. The SDK does nothing with the data, which can be any valid JSON item as an `LDValue` instance.

Optionally, you can add a `metricValue` parameter of type `Double` to `track` in Swift or as a required parameter to the overloaded `track` method in Objective-C.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Swift">

```swift
let data: LDValue = ["some-custom-key": "some-custom-value", "another-custom-key": 7]
try LDClient.get()!.track(key: "MY_TRACK_EVENT_NAME", data: data)
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Objective-C">

```objectivec
LDValue *data = [LDValue ofArray:@[[LDValue ofBool:YES], [LDValue ofNumber:@5.5]]];
[[LDClient get] trackWithKey:@"MY_TRACK_EVENT_NAME" data:data];
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn more, read the generated API documentation for [Swift](https://launchdarkly.github.io/ios-client-sdk/Classes/LDClient.html#/Events) or [Objective-C](https://launchdarkly.github.io/ios-client-sdk/Classes/ObjcLDClient.html#/Events).
</Details>

### JavaScript

<Details summary="Expand JavaScript code sample">

You can record `custom` events using the `track` function. In LaunchDarkly, you can connect these events to metrics in experiments. To learn more, read [About Experimentation](/home/about-experimentation).

Call `track` with the event name to record custom conversion metrics.

The second argument is optional. It assists with observational analytics for Data Export destinations. With Data Export, the second argument gives additional information without saving the data to the LaunchDarkly context.

To call `track`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
client.track('event-name-123abc', { customProperty: someValue });
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn how to attach custom data to your event with optional parameters, read [`track`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDClient.html#track).

#### Tracking click and page view events in JavaScript
---
<br/>

If you've defined click or page view metrics in LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been initialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click or page view metrics.

To learn more about click and page view metrics, read [About Experimentation](/home/about-experimentation).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Single-page apps</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The SDK automatically handles URL changes made by the HTML5 history API or by changing the URL hash fragment, and will trigger <code>click</code> and <code>page view</code> events correctly.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

#### Analytics in JavaScript
---

Evaluating flags, either with `variation()` or with `allFlags()`, produces analytics events which you can observe on your LaunchDarkly **Debugger** page. The initial context you specify in the client constructor, as well as any context you specify with `identify()`, produces an analytics event which is how LaunchDarkly receives your context data.

You can also explicitly send an event with any data you like using the `track` function. The second argument is optional. For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
client.track('your-event-name', { customProperty: someValue });
```
</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you define click conversion or page view conversion metrics in LaunchDarkly, the SDK sends them automatically after you have initialized the client. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click or page view goals. The SDK will generate `page view` events correctly regardless of how the URL is changed, such as by the HTML5 history API, by changing the URL hash fragment, etc.

To learn more about metrics, read [Creating metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Do Not Track and ad blocking software</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The JavaScript SDK respects the [Do Not Track events](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) header. If an end user has Do Not Track enabled in their browser, the SDK does not send analytics events for flag evaluations or goals to `events.launchdarkly.com`. In addition, ad blocking software may block analytics events from being sent. This does not impact feature flag evaluations.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>
</Details>

### Node.js (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand Node.js (client-side) code sample">

The `track` method lets you record actions your users take, giving them any event name you want. This lets you record events that take place client-side. The current user data automatically accompany the event.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
client.track('something-happened');

client.track('something-happened-with-custom-data', { someData: 2 });
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn how to attach custom data to your event with optional parameters, read [`track`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/node-client-sdk/interfaces/LDClient.html#track).
