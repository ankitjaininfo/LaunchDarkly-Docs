## Overview

This topic explains how to configure user and context objects in LaunchDarkly SDKs. These features are available for both client-side and server-side SDKs.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Newer versions of LaunchDarkly SDKs replace users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts replace another data object in LaunchDarkly: "users." To learn more, read [Contexts and segments](/home/contexts).

Creating contexts and evaluating flags based on them is supported in the latest major versions of [most of our SDKs](/sdk). For these SDKs, the code samples on this page include the two most recent versions.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Configuring context objects

Every LaunchDarkly SDK lets you configure context or user objects to return specific data to LaunchDarkly. Any attributes you pass to LaunchDarkly become available on the **Contexts** list. The attribute values determine which variation of a feature flag the customer receives.

Every object is required to have a `key`. Keys are always transmitted to LaunchDarkly. Typically, you supply the key when you create the context. If you are using a client-side SDK and mark the context as anonymous, the SDK can generate the key for you. To learn more, read [Designating anonymous contexts](#designating-anonymous-contexts).

Keys must be a string type. Keys must be unique, deterministic, and should not contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Keys must be consistent, which means the same person must correspond to the same key across different services to contribute to consistent flag evaluations and accurate monthly active users (MAU). You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same person always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible.

### Using built-in and custom attributes

Attributes other than the key are optional. There are two types of attributes: built-in attributes, which are LaunchDarkly names, and custom attributes, which you can name anything you choose.

When you work with an SDK that supports contexts, the only built-in attributes are `kind`, `key`, `name`, and `anonymous`.

You can define additional attributes for a context by passing in a name and value for each. These additional attributes let you add targeting rules for your flags based on any data that you want to send to LaunchDarkly. Attribute values can be any JSON type, including boolean, number, string, array, or object. To learn more, read [Context attributes](/home/contexts/attributes).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Custom and built-in attributes cannot share names</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you create an attribute with a name already in use by a built-in attribute, the SDK will behave unpredictably during feature flag evaluation.

When you work with an SDK that supports contexts, the only built-in attributes are `kind`, `key`, `name`, and `anonymous`. If you work with an SDK that only supports users, there are several additional built-in attributes.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

### Using private attributes

Each SDK lets you configure private attributes. You can use private attributes for targeting purposes, but these attributes are removed from data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

### Designating anonymous contexts

Each SDK lets you designate anonymous contexts or users. Anonymous contexts or users don't appear on your **Contexts** list, so you can't search for them, and you can't search for or autocomplete by their keys. If you use the same key for every anonymous context or user, you also can't use Experimentation, because tracking events are attributed to the context key.

In client-side SDKs, if you don't provide a key or set it to null, and set `anonymous` to `true`, then the SDK generates a random key for you.

If you want to reduce your client-side MAU, we recommend using the same key for every initialization and then replacing that with a different key, unique to each context, when you know which person or entity the context represents. This way LaunchDarkly counts the initialization key only once against your client-side MAU, instead of every time you initialize. However, you cannot use this method if you use Experimentation, because all contexts you include in an experiment must have a unique key.

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

* [Client-side SDKs](#client-side-sdks)
* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

Here are the configuration options for context and user entities in client-side SDKs.

### .NET (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (client-side) code sample">

In the client-side .NET SDK, you can construct a simple `Context`, with a context kind of "user", that only has a key by calling `Context.New`. Alternatively, you can use `Context.Builder`, which allows setting all properties.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v3.0 (C#)">

```csharp
Context context = Context.Builder("context-key-123abc")
    .Set("firstName", "Sandy")
    .Set("lastName", "Smith")
    .Set("email", "sandy@example.com")
    .Set("group", "microsoft")
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v2.x (C#)">

```csharp
LDUser user = User.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .FirstName("Sandy")
    .LastName("Smith")
    .Email("sandy@example.com")
    .Custom("group", "Microsoft")
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `Builder` is the context's key. The key should uniquely identify each context. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"context-key-123abc"`.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Interpreting attribute types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The optional name and kind attributes, which you can set with `.Name()` and `.Kind()`, expect string values. If the kind attribute is not specified, it is assumed to be "user." Other attribute values can be any JSON type, including booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, or objects. The SDK uses the [`LdValue`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-client-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.LdValue.html) type to represent arrays and objects. The client-side .NET SDK is strongly-typed, so be aware of this distinction.

If an attribute is an object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

#### Private attributes in the client-side .NET SDK
---

You can optionally configure the client-side .NET SDK to treat some or all attributes as [private attributes](/home/contexts/attributes). Private attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

In the client-side .NET SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the entire LaunchDarkly client:

- When creating the LaunchDarkly `Configuration` object, you can call the `AllAttributesPrivate` method, which takes in a boolean parameter. If `true`, all context attributes except the kind and key are removed for all contexts before the SDK sends the context to LaunchDarkly.
- When creating the LaunchDarkly `Configuration` object, you can call the `PrivateAttributes` method, which takes any number of attribute names or slash-delimited paths to designated JSON properties within an attribute, such as `/address/street`. If any context has a custom or built-in attribute that matches one of these names, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

You can also mark attributes as private when building the context object by calling `Private()` on the context builder.

For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v3.0 (C#)">

```csharp
var context = Context.Builder("context-key-123abc")
    .Set("email", "sandy@example.com")
    .Private("email")
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v2.x (C#)">

```csharp
var user = User.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .Email("sandy@example.com").AsPrivateAttribute()
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When the SDK sends this context back to LaunchDarkly, it removes the `email` attribute.

#### Anonymous contexts in the client-side .NET SDK
---

You can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v3.0 (C#)">

```csharp
Context context = Context.Builder("context-key-123abc")
    .Anonymous(true)
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v2.x (C#)">

```csharp
LDUser user = User.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .Anonymous(true)
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You still need to generate a key for anonymous contexts. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this.

If you don't use Experimentation, we recommend using the same context key for every initialization and then replacing that with a different key, unique to each context, when you know which person or entity the context represents. This way LaunchDarkly counts the initialization context key only once against your MAU, instead of every time you initialize.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v3.0 (C#)">

```csharp
Configuration config = Configuration.Builder("mobile-key-123abc")
    .GenerateAnonymousKeys(true)
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you set this option, the SDK will generate a key for any context whose `anonymous` attribute is true. You must still specify a non-null key as a placeholder when you construct the `Context`, because the SDK does not allow a `Context` to exist with a null key. When you pass this context to SDK methods like `Init` or `Identify`, the SDK replaces the placeholder key with a generated key.

In this example, the placeholder key is "unknown-context-key", but it could be any non-empty string:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v3.0 (C#)">

```csharp
Context context = Context.Builder("unknown-context-key")
    .Anonymous(true)
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v2.x (C#)">

```csharp
LDUser user = User.Builder((string)null).Anonymous(true).Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
</Details>

### Android

<Details summary="Expand Android code sample">

In the Android SDK, use a [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) to construct contexts.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v4.0 (Java)">

```java
LDContext context = LDContext.builder("context-key-123abc")
    .set("email", "sandy@example.com")
    .set("firstName", "Sandy")
    .set("lastName", "Smith")
    .set("group", "Microsoft")
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v4.0 (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val context: LDContext = LDContext.builder("context-key-123abc")
    .set("email", "sandy@example.com")
    .set("firstName", "Sandy")
    .set("lastName", "Smith")
    .set("group", "Microsoft")
    .build()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v3.x (Java)">

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .email("sandy@example.com")
    .firstName("Sandy")
    .lastName("Smith")
    .custom("group", "Microsoft")
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v3.x (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val user: LDUser = LDUser.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .email("sandy@example.com")
    .firstName("Sandy")
    .lastName("Smith")
    .custom("group", "Microsoft")
    .build()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `Builder` is the context's key. The key should uniquely identify each context. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"context-key-123abc"`.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Interpreting custom attribute types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The optional name and kind attributes, which you can set with `.name()` and `.kind()`, expect string values. If the kind attribute is not specified, it is assumed to be "user." Other attribute values can be any JSON type, including boolean, number, string, array, or object. The Android SDK is strongly-typed, so be aware of this distinction.

If an attribute is an object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

#### Private attributes in the Android SDK
---

You can optionally configure the Android SDK to treat some or all attributes as [private context attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes). Private attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the context data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

In the Android SDK you can define private attributes for the entire LaunchDarkly client. When creating the `LDConfig` object, call the `privateAttributes` method, which takes in a set of custom or built-in attributes as a parameter. If any context has a custom or built-in attribute named in this set, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

Here's how to configure private attributes:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v4.0 (Java)">

```java
LDConfig ldConfig = new LDConfig.Builder()
    .events(
        Components.sendEvents()
            .privateAttributes("name", "group")
    )
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v4.0 (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
LDConfig ldConfig = new LDConfig.Builder()
    .events(
        Components.sendEvents()
            .privateAttributes("name", "group")
    )
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v3.x (Java)">

```java
LDConfig ldConfig = new LDConfig.Builder()
    .privateAttributes(UserAttribute.NAME, UserAttribute.forName("group"))
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v3.x (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val ldConfig: LDConfig = LDConfig.Builder()
    .privateAttributes(UserAttribute.NAME, UserAttribute.forName("group"))
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also mark attributes as private when building the context object by using the private versions of the builder methods to set the attributes. For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v4.0 (Java)">

```java
LDContext context = LDContext.builder("context-key-123abc")
    .set("email", "sandy@example.com")
    .set("name", "Sandy")
    .set("group", "Microsoft")
    .privateAttributes("name", "group")
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v4.0 (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val context: LDContext = LDContext.builder("context-key-123abc")
    .set("email", "sandy@example.com")
    .set("name", "Sandy")
    .set("group", "Microsoft")
    .privateAttributes("name", "group")
    .build()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v3.x (Java)">

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .email("sandy@example.com")
    .privateName("Sandy")
    .privateCustom("group", "Microsoft")
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v3.x (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val user: LDUser = LDUser.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .email("sandy@example.com")
    .privateName("Sandy")
    .privateCustom("group", "Microsoft")
    .build()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When the SDK sends this context back to LaunchDarkly, it removes the `name` and `group` attributes.

#### Anonymous contexts in the Android SDK
---

You can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v4.0 (Java)">

```java
LDContext context = LDContext.builder("context-key-123abc")
    .anonymous(true)
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v4.0 (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val context: LDContext = LDContext.builder("context-key-123abc")
    .anonymous(true)
    .build()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v3.x (Java)">

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .anonymous(true)
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v3.x (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val user: LDUser = LDUser.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .anonymous(true)
    .build()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When you mark the context as anonymous, you can leave the key parameter in the Builder null or make it an empty string. The client will automatically set it to a LaunchDarkly-specific, device-unique string that is consistent between app restarts and device reboots.

If you don't use Experimentation, we recommend using the same context key for every initialization and then replacing that with a different key, unique to each context, when you know which person or entity the context represents. This way LaunchDarkly counts the initialization context key only once against your MAU, instead of every time you initialize.
</Details>

### C/C++ (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand C/C++ (client-side) code sample">

In the C/C++ (client-side) SDK, you can construct a user using `LDUserNew`.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
struct LDJSON *attributes, *groups;
groups = LDNewArray();
LDArrayPush(groups, LDNewText("Google"));
LDArrayPush(groups, LDNewText("Microsoft"));
attributes = LDNewObject();
LDObjectSetKey("groups", groups);
struct LDUser *user = LDUserNew("user-key-123abc");
LDUserSetFirstName(user, "Sandy");
LDUserSetLastName(user, "Smith");
LDUserSetCustomAttributesJSON(user, attributes);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `LDUserNew` is the user's key. The key should uniquely identify each user. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"user-key-123abc"`.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Interpreting custom attribute types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Most of the built-in attributes, like names and email addresses, expect string values. Custom attributes values can be booleans, numbers, strings, or arrays. If you enter a custom value on the **Users** list that looks like a number or a boolean, the SDK interprets it that way.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

#### Private user attributes in the C/C++ SDK
---

You can optionally configure the C/C++ SDK to treat some or all user attributes as private user attributes. Private user attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the user data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

In the C/C++ SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the LaunchDarkly client:

- When creating the `LDConfig` object, you can set the `allAttributesPrivate` value to `true`. When you do this, all user attributes except the key are removed before the SDK sends the user to LaunchDarkly.
- When creating the `LDConfig` object, you can configure a map of `privateAttributeNames`. If any user has a custom or built-in attribute named in this list, the SDK removes it before sending the user to LaunchDarkly.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
struct LDConfig *config = LDConfigNew("mobile-key-123abc");
// Mark all attributes private
LDConfigSetAllAttributesPrivate(config, true);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

#### Anonymous users in the C/C++ SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
struct LDUser *user = LDUserNew("user-key-123abc");
LDUserSetAnonymous(user, true);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you don't use Experimentation, we recommend using the same user key for every initialization and then replacing that with the actual user key when you know who the user is. This way LaunchDarkly counts the initialization user key only once against your MAU, instead of every time you initialize.
</Details>

### Electron

<Details summary="Expand Electron code sample">

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Personally-identifying user keys</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

By default, when the SDK requests feature flags from LaunchDarkly, it makes an HTTP GET request with the user properties encoded in the URL. If you do not want user keys or other properties to be in request URLs, enable the `useReport` option in your client configuration. The SDK sends user data in the body of an HTTP REPORT request instead.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here's an example of a user:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
const user = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  firstName: 'Sandy',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  custom: {
    groups: ['Google', 'Microsoft']
  }
};
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```ts
import * as LDElectron from 'launchdarkly-electron-client-sdk';

const user: LDElectron.LDUser = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  firstName: 'Sandy',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  custom: {
    groups: ['Google', 'Microsoft'],
  },
};
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The `key` property is the user's key. The key should uniquely identify each user. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"user-key-123abc"`.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Interpreting custom attribute types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Most of the built-in attributes, like names and email addresses, expect string values. Custom attribute values can be booleans, numbers, strings, or arrays. If you enter a custom value on the **Users** list that looks like a number or a boolean, the SDK interprets it that way.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

#### Private user attributes in the Electron SDK
---

You can optionally configure the SDK to treat all user attributes as [private user attributes](/home/contexts/attributes). Private user attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but the SDK removes them from the user data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

To mark all user attributes except the key as private, you can use the `allAttributesPrivate` option:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
const user = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  name: 'Sandy Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com'
};

const client = LDElectron.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', user, {
  allAttributesPrivate: true
});
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```ts
import * as LDElectron from 'launchdarkly-electron-client-sdk';

const user: LDElectron.LDUser = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  name: 'Sandy Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
};

const client = LDElectron.initializeInMain('client-side-id-123abc', user, {
  allAttributesPrivate: true,
});
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

In the above example, the SDK removes the `name` and `email` attributes.

You can also specify an array of which attributes should be private with the `privateAttributeNames` option. You can configure this option on a per-user basis by specifying which attributes should be private in your user object.

This option is configured in both the user object and the configuration object:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
const user = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  name: 'Sandy Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  privateAttributeNames: ['email']
};

const client = LDElectron.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', user, {
  privateAttributeNames: ['email']
});
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```ts
import * as LDElectron from 'launchdarkly-electron-client-sdk';

const user: LDElectron.LDUser = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  name: 'Sandy Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  privateAttributeNames: ['email'],
};

const client = LDElectron.initializeInMain('client-side-id-123abc', user, {
  privateAttributeNames: ['email'],
});
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

In the above example, the SDK sends only the `key` and `name` back to LaunchDarkly.

#### Anonymous users in the Electron SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
// To create an anonymous user with an auto-generated key, specify
// the "anonymous" property and omit the "key" property. The LaunchDarkly
// client creates a unique key for this user and caches it locally.
const anonymousUser = { anonymous: true };

// You can also specify any key you want:
const anonymousUser2 = { key: 'user-key-123abc', anonymous: true };
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```ts
import * as LDElectron from 'launchdarkly-electron-client-sdk';

// To create an anonymous user with an auto-generated key, specify
// the "anonymous" property and omit the "key" property. The LaunchDarkly
// client creates a unique key for this user and caches it locally.
const anonymousUser: LDElectron.LDUser = { anonymous: true };

// You can also specify any key you want:
const anonymousUser2: LDElectron.LDUser = { key: 'user-key-123abc', anonymous: true };
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you don't use Experimentation, we recommend using the same user key for every initialization and then replacing that with the actual user key when you know who the user is. This way LaunchDarkly counts the initialization user key only once against your MAU, instead of every time you initialize.

### Flutter

<Details summary="Expand Flutter code sample">

In the Flutter SDK, use a [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) to construct users.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Dart">

```dart
LDUser user = LDUserBuilder('user-key-123abc')
    .email('sandy@example.com')
    .firstName('Sandy')
    .lastName('Smith')
    .custom('group', LDValue.ofString('microsoft'))
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `LDUserBuilder` is the user's key. The key should uniquely identify each user. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"user-key-123abc"`.

Most of the built-in attributes, like names and email addresses, expect string values. Custom attributes values can be booleans, numbers, strings, or arrays. Custom attribute values in the Flutter SDK use the `LDValue` class to support the various underlying types for the values. If you enter a custom value on the **Users** list that looks like a number or a boolean, the SDK interprets it that way. The Flutter SDK is strongly-typed, so be aware of this distinction.

#### Private user attributes in the Flutter SDK
---

Optionally, you can configure the Flutter SDK to treat some or all user attributes as private user attributes. You can use private user attributes for targeting purposes. They are removed from the user data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

In the Flutter SDK, you can define private attributes for the **entire** LaunchDarkly client. When you create the `LDConfig` object, you can call the `privateAttributeNames` method, which takes in a set of custom or built-in attributes as a parameter. If any user has a custom or built-in attribute named in this set, the SDK removes it before sending the user to LaunchDarkly.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Dart">

```dart
Set<String> privateAttributes =
  { 'name' // built-in attribute
  , 'group' // custom attribute
  };

LDConfig ldConfig = new LDConfigBuilder()
    .privateAttributeNames(privateAttributes)
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also mark attributes as private when building the user object by using the private versions of the builder methods to set the attributes. For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Dart">

```dart
LDUser user = LDUserBuilder('user-key-123abc')
    .email('sandy@example.com')
    .privateName('Jane')
    .privateCustom('group', LDValue.ofString('microsoft'))
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When the SDK sends this user back to LaunchDarkly, the `name` and `group` attributes are removed.

#### Anonymous users in the Flutter SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Dart">

```dart
LDUser user = LDUserBuilder('user key')
    .anonymous(true)
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you don't use Experimentation, we recommend using the same user key for every initialization and then replacing that with the actual user key when you know who the user is. This way LaunchDarkly counts the initialization user key only once against your MAU, instead of every time you initialize.

### iOS

<Details summary="Expand iOS code sample">

You can pass optional properties to the context object in iOS:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v8.0 (Swift)">

```swift
var contextBuilder = LDContextBuilder(key: "user-key-123abc")
contextBuilder.trySetValue("name", .string("Sandy"))
contextBuilder.trySetValue("email", .string("sandy@example.com"))

let context = try contextBuilder.build().get()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v8.0 (Objective-C)">

```objectivec
LDContextBuilder *builder = [[LDContextBuilder alloc] initWithKey:@"context-key-123abc"];
[builder trySetValueWithName:@"name" value:[LDValue ofString:@"Sandy"]];
[builder trySetValueWithName:@"email" value:[LDValue ofString:@"sandy@example.com"]];

LDContext *context = builder.build.success;
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v7.x (Swift)">

```swift
var user = LDUser(key: "user-key-123abc")
user.name = "Sandy"
user.email = "sandy@example.com"
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v7.x (Objective-C)">

```objectivec
LDUser *user = [[LDUser alloc] initWithKey:@"user-key-123abc"];
user.name = @"Sandy";
user.email = @"sandy@example.com";
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

This example sets a key and adds the end user's full name and email address.

The `key` property should uniquely identify each context. You can define additional attributes for a context by passing in a name and value for each. Additional attributes can be any JSON type, including boolean, number, string, array, or object. If an attribute is a JSON object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

To learn more about the specific context properties that are available in this SDK, read [`LDContextBuilder`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/ios-client-sdk/Structs/LDContextBuilder.html).

#### Private attributes in the iOS SDK
---

You can optionally configure the iOS SDK to treat some or all context attributes as private attributes. Private attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the context data the SDK sends to LaunchDarkly.

In the iOS SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the entire LaunchDarkly client:

- When creating the `LDConfig` object, you can set the `allContextAttributesPrivate` attribute to `true`.
- When creating the LDConfig object, you can set the `privateContextAttributes` property to a list of `Reference`s, such as `[Reference("name"), Reference("/address/state")]`. If any context has a custom or built-in attribute named in this list, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

You can also mark attributes as private on a particular `LDContext` instance, for example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v8.0 (Swift)">

```swift
var contextBuilder = LDContextBuilder(key: "context-key-123abc")
contextBuilder.trySetValue("name", .string("Sandy"))
contextBuilder.trySetValue("group", .array([LDValue(stringLiteral: "microsoft")]))
contextBuilder.addPrivateAttribute(Reference("name"))
contextBuilder.addPrivateAttribute(Reference("group"))

let context = try contextBuilder.build().get()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v8.0 (Objective-C)">

```objectivec
LDContextBuilder *builder = [[LDContextBuilder alloc] initWithKey:@"context-key-123abc"];
[builder trySetValueWithName:@"name" value:[LDValue ofString:@"Sandy"]];

NSArray *groups = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:[LDValue ofString:@"microsoft"], nil];
[builder trySetValueWithName:@"group" value:[LDValue ofArray:groups]];

[builder addPrivateAttributeWithReference:[[Reference alloc] initWithValue:@"email"]];
[builder addPrivateAttributeWithReference:[[Reference alloc] initWithValue:@"group"]];

LDContext *context = builder.build.success;
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v7.x (Swift)">

```swift
var user = LDUser(key: "user-key-123abc", name: "Sandy", custom: ["group": "microsoft"])
user.privateAttributes = [UserAttribute.BuiltIn.name, UserAttribute.forName("group")]
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v7.x (Objective-C)">

```objectivec
LDUser *user = [[LDUser alloc] initWithKey:@"user-key-123abc"];
user.name = @"Sandy";
user.custom = @{@"group": [LDValue ofString:@"microsoft"]};
user.privateAttributes = @[@"name", @"group"];
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

#### Anonymous contexts in the iOS SDK
---

You can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v8.0 (Swift)">

```swift
var contextBuilder = LDContextBuilder(key: "context-key-123abc")
contextBuilder.anonymous(true)

let context = contextBuilder.build().get()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v8.0 (Objective-C)">

```objectivec
LDContextBuilder *builder = [[LDContextBuilder alloc] initWithKey:@"context-key-123abc"];
[builder trySetValueWithName:@"anonymous" value:[LDValue ofBool:true]];

LDContext *context = builder.build.success;
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v7.x (Swift)">

```swift
var user = LDUser(key: "user-key-123abc")
user.isAnonymous = true
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v7.x (Objective-C)">

```objectivec
LDUser *user = [[LDUser alloc] initWithKey:@"user-key-123abc"];
user.isAnonymous = YES;
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You still need to generate a key for anonymous contexts. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this.

Alternatively, you can omit the key parameter. The client will automatically set the `isAnonymous` property for the context, and set the key to a LaunchDarkly-specific, device-unique string that is consistent between app restarts and device reboots.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v8.0 (Swift)">

```swift
// Have the SDK use a device persistent key. 
// This sets `isAnonymous` by default.
let context = try LDContextBuilder().build().get()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v8.0 (Objective-C)">

```objectivec
// Have the SDK use a device persistent key. 
// This sets `isAnonymous` by default.
LDContextBuilder *newThing = [[LDContextBuilder alloc] init];
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v7.x (Swift)">

```swift
// Have the SDK use a device persistent key. 
// This sets `isAnonymous` by default.
let user = LDUser()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v7.x (Objective-C)">

```objectivec
// Have the SDK use a device persistent key. 
// This sets `isAnonymous` by default.
LDUser *user = [LDUser new];
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you don't use Experimentation, we recommend using the same context key for every initialization and then replacing that with a different key, unique to each context, when you know which person or entity the context represents. This way LaunchDarkly counts the initialization context key only once against your MAU, instead of every time you initialize.

### JavaScript

<Details summary="Expand JavaScript code sample">

Here's an example of a context:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v3.0">

```js
const context = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  firstName: 'Sandy',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  groups: ['Google', 'Microsoft']
};
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v3.0 (TypeScript)">

```ts
import * as ld from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

const context: ld.LDContext = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  firstName: 'Sandy',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  groups: ['Google', 'Microsoft']
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v2.x">

```js
const user = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  firstName: 'Sandy',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  custom: {
    groups: ['Google', 'Microsoft']
  }
};
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v2.x (TypeScript)">

```ts
import * as ld from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

const user: ld.LDUser = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  firstName: 'Sandy',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  custom: {
    groups: ['Google', 'Microsoft'],
  },
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The `key` property should uniquely identify each context. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `user-key-123abc`.

The optional `name` and `kind` attributes expect string values. If the `kind` attribute is not specified, it is assumed to be "user." Other attributes can be booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, or JSON objects. If an attribute is a JSON object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Personally-identifying context keys</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

We recommend against using personally identifiable information (PII) in context keys. If the `key` attribute you rely on in your context JSON does contain PII, you should enable the `useReport` option by sending the evaluation context as a JSON base64 URL-encoded path parameter. When you enable `useReport`, the SDK fetches flag settings by sending the context JSON in the body of a REPORT request instead, hiding that information from request logs.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

#### Private attributes in the JavaScript SDK
---

You can optionally configure the JavaScript SDK to treat all attributes as [private context attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes). Private attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the context data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

To mark all attributes except the key as private in the JavaScript SDK, you can use the `allAttributesPrivate` option:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v3.0">

```js
const context = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  name: 'Sandy Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com'
};

const ldclient = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', context, options = {
  allAttributesPrivate: true
});
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v3.0 (TypeScript)">

```ts
import * as ld from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

const context: ld.LDContext = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  name: 'Sandy Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
}
const options: ld.LDOptions = { allAttributesPrivate: true };

const client = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', context, options);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v2.x">

```js
const user = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  name: 'Sandy Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com'
};

const ldclient = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', user, options = {
  allAttributesPrivate: true
});
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v2.x (TypeScript)">

```ts
import * as ld from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

const user: ld.LDUser = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  name: 'Sandy Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
}
const options: ld.LDOptions = { allAttributesPrivate: true };

const client = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', user, options);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

In the above example, the `name` and `email` attributes are removed.

You can configure this option either in the configuration object or in the context object, by specifying an array of attributes that should be private. In the configuration object, specify your array of attributes in the `privateAttributes` configuration option. In the context object, specify your array of attributes in the `privateNames` field of the reserved `_meta` property.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v3.0">

```js
const context = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'context-key-123abc',
  name: 'Sandy Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  _meta: {
    privateAttributes: ['email']
  }
};

const ldclient = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', context, options = {
  privateAttributes: ['email']
});
```

  _meta: {
    privateAttributes: ['email'],
  }
};
const options: ld.LDOptions = { privateAttributes: ['email'] };

const client = ld.initialize('client-side-123abc', context, options);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v2.x">

```js
const user = {
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  name: 'Sandy Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  privateAttributeNames: ['email']
};

const ldclient = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', user, options = {
  privateAttributeNames: ['email']
});
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v2.x (TypeScript)">

```ts

const user: ld.LDUser = {

  privateAttributeNames: ['email'],
};
const options: ld.LDOptions = { privateAttributeNames: ['email'] };

const client = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', user, options);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

In the above example, the SDK sends only the context's key and name back to LaunchDarkly.

#### Anonymous contexts in the JavaScript SDK
---

You can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

If you use [multi-contexts](/home/contexts#understanding-contexts-and-context-kinds), you can choose to make only some contexts anonymous.

To create an anonymous context, specify the `anonymous` property and omit the `key` property. The client will automatically set the key to a LaunchDarkly-specific, device-unique string that is consistent between app restarts and device reboots.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v3.0">

```js
const anonymousUserContext = {
  kind: 'user',
  anonymous: true
};

// A multi-context can contain both anonymous and non-anonymous contexts.
// Here, the organization is not anonymous.
const multiContext = {
  kind: 'multi',
  user: anonymousUserContext,
  org: {
    key: 'org-key',
    name: 'Example organization name'
  }
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v3.0 (TypeScript)">

```ts
import * as ld from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

const anonymousContext: ld.LDContext = {
  kind: 'user',
  anonymous: true
};

// A multi-context can contain both anonymous and non-anonymous contexts.
// Here, the organization is not anonymous.
const multiContext: ld.LDContext = {
  kind: 'multi',
  user: anonymousUserContext,
  org: {
    key: 'org-key-123abc',
    name: 'Example organization name'
  }
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v2.x">

```js
const anonymousUser = { anonymous: true };
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript SDK v2.x (TypeScript)">

```ts

### Node.js (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand Node.js (client-side) code sample">

Here's an example of a context:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v3.0 (JavaScript)">

The key should uniquely identify each context. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"user-key-123abc"`.

The `kind` and `name` attributes expect string values. Other attribute values can be booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, or JSON objects. If an attribute is a JSON object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use / as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use <code>/address/city</code> in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Personally-identifying user keys</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

By default, when the SDK requests feature flags from LaunchDarkly, it makes an HTTP GET request with the user properties encoded in the URL. If you do not want user keys or other properties to be in request URLs, enable the `useReport` option in your client configuration. The SDK sends user data in the body of an HTTP REPORT request instead.

const options: ld.LDOptions = { allAttributesPrivate: true };

const client = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', user, options);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

In the above example, the `name` and `email` attributes are removed.

You can also specify an array of which attributes should be private with the `privateAttributes` option. You can configure this option on a per-context basis by specifying which attributes should be private in your context object.

You can configure this option in both the context object and the configuration object:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v3.0 (JavaScript)">

```js
const context = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'user-key-123abc',

};
const options: ld.LDOptions = { allAttributesPrivate: ['email'] };

const client = ld.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', user, options);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

In the above example, the SDK sends only the context key and name back to LaunchDarkly.

#### Anonymous contexts in the Node.js SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v3.0 (JavaScript)">

```js
const anonymousContext = { kind: 'user', key: "user-key-123abc", anonymous: true };
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v3.0 (TypeScript)">

```ts
import * as ld from 'launchdarkly-node-client-sdk';

const anonymousContext: ld.LDContext = { kind: 'user', key: 'user-key-123abc', anonymous: true };
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v2.x (JavaScript)">

```js
const anonymousUser = { key: "user-key-123abc", anonymous: true };
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v2.x (TypeScript)">

```ts
import * as ld from 'launchdarkly-node-client-sdk';

const anonymousUser: ld.LDUser = { key: 'user-key-123abc', anonymous: true };
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also have the SDK generate the key for you. Specify the `anonymous` property and omit the `key` property. The client will automatically set the key to a LaunchDarkly-specific, device-unique string that is consistent between app restarts and device reboots.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v3.0 (JavaScript)">

```js
const anonymousContext = { kind: 'user', anonymous: true };
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v3.0 (TypeScript)">

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you don't use Experimentation, we recommend using the same context key for every initialization and then replacing that with a different key, unique to each context, when you know which person or entity the context represents. This way LaunchDarkly counts the initialization context key only once against your MAU, instead of every time you initialize.

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The first attribute in the object is the `key`. In the example, the value is `user-key-123abc`. In the React Native SDK, both `key` and `kind` required. They are the only mandatory attributes. If you mark the context as anonymous, the SDK can generate the key for you.

The combination of `key` and `kind` should uniquely identify each context. You can use any value for the key, such as a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible.

Other attributes can be booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, or JSON objects. If an attribute is a JSON object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

#### Private attributes in the React Native SDK
---

You can optionally configure the React Native SDK to treat attributes as [private context attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes). Private attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the context data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

You can configure this option in the configuration object, to apply to all contexts, either for all attributes or some attributes. Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Mark all attributes private in config object">

```js
const config = {
  mobileKey: 'mobile-key-123abc',
  allAttributesPrivate: true
};
await ldClient.configure(config, context);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Mark some attributes private in config object">

```js
const config = {
  mobileKey: 'mobile-key-123abc',
  privateAttributes: ['email', 'address']
};
await ldClient.configure(config, context);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn more, read `allAttributesPrivate` and `privateAttributes` on [`LDConfig`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/index.html#LDConfig).

You can also mark an attribute as private for a particular context. Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Mark attributes private for one context">

```js
const context = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  firstName: 'Sandy',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Springfield'
  },
  _meta: {
    privateAttributes: ['email', '/address/street']
  }
};
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

For attributes that are objects, you can mark specific fields private, using the `/` delimiter followed by the attribute name, then the `/` delimiter followed by the JSON property within the value. In the example, the attribute `"address": { "street": "Main St", "city": "Springfield" }` has only the `/address/street` marked as private.

#### Anonymous contexts in the React Native SDK
---

You can distinguish logged out or unregistered end users from logged-in end users in the SDK. Anonymous contexts are just like regular contexts, except that they do not appear on the **Contexts** list in LaunchDarkly. This prevents unauthenticated end users from diluting useful data on the **Contexts** list.

If you use [multi-contexts](/home/contexts#understanding-contexts-and-context-kinds), you can choose to make only some contexts anonymous.

To create an create an anonymous context, specify the `anonymous` property. If you omit the context key when building an anonymous context, the client will automatically set it to a LaunchDarkly-specific, device-unique string that is consistent between app restarts and device reboots. If you omit the context key and do not mark the context as anonymous, the SDK gives a usage error.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Working with anonymous contexts">

```js
// This user context is not anonymous
const userContext = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'user-key-123abc'
}

// This device context is anonymous
// The key is omitted, and the SDK will automatically generate one
const deviceContext = {
  kind: 'device',
  deviceId: '12345',
  anonymous: true
}

// The multi-context contains one anonymous context
// and one non-anonymous context
const multiContext = {
  kind: 'multi',
  user: userContext,
  device: deviceContext
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

We recommend using the same context key for every initialization and then replacing that a different key, unique to each context, when you know which person or entity the context represents. This way LaunchDarkly counts the initialization user key only once against your MAU, instead of every time you initialize.
</Details>

### React Web

All context-related functionality provided by the [JavaScript SDK](#javascript) is also available in the React SDK.

Unlike the JavaScript SDK, the React SDK does not require a context object for initialization. If you do not specify one, the React SDK uses an anonymous context by default.

## Server-side SDKs

Here are the configuration options for context and user entities in server-side SDKs:

* [.NET (server-side)](#net-server-side)
* [Apex](#apex)
* [C/C++ (server-side)](#cc-server-side)
* [Erlang](#erlang)
* [Go](#go)
* [Haskell](#haskell)

* [PHP](#php)
* [Python](#python)

* [Rust](#rust)

### .NET (server-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (server-side) code sample">

In the .NET SDK, the [`Context`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Context.html) class has a `New` method for creating a simple context, with a context kind of "user" and with only a key. It has a `Builder` method for building a context with other properties.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v7.0 (C#)">

```csharp
LDContext context = Context.Builder("context-key-123abc")
    .Set("firstName", "Sandy")
    .Set("lastName", "Smith")
    .Set("email", "sandy@example.com")
    .Set("groups", LdValue.ArrayOf(LdValue.Of("Google"), LdValue.Of("Microsoft")))
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v6.x (C#)">

```csharp
LDUser user = User.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .FirstName("Sandy")
    .LastName("Smith")
    .Email("sandy@example.com")
    .Custom("groups", LdValue.ArrayOf(LdValue.Of("Google"), LdValue.Of("Microsoft")))
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `Builder` is the context's key. The key should uniquely identify each context. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `context-key-123abc`.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Interpreting custom attribute types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The optional name and kind attributes, which you can set with `.Name()` and `.Kind()`, expect string values. If the kind attribute is not specified, it is assumed to be "user". Other attribute values can be booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, or JSON objects. The SDK uses the [`LdValue`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.LdValue.html) type to represent arrays and objects. The .NET SDK is strongly-typed, so be aware of this distinction.

If an attribute is a JSON object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

#### Private attributes in the .NET SDK
---

You can optionally configure the .NET SDK to treat some or all context attributes as [private attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes). You can use private context attributes for targeting purposes, but the SDK removes private context attributes from the data it sends to LaunchDarkly.

In the server-side .NET SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the entire LaunchDarkly client:

- When creating the LaunchDarkly `Configuration` object, you can configure [`Events`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.ConfigurationBuilder.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_ConfigurationBuilder_Events_) with [`AllAttributesPrivate`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.Integrations.EventProcessorBuilder.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_Integrations_EventProcessorBuilder_AllAttributesPrivate_), which takes in a boolean parameter. If `true`, the SDK removes all attributes for all contexts before sending the context to LaunchDarkly, except the key.
- Or, you can configure `Events` with [`PrivateAttributes`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.Integrations.EventProcessorBuilder.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_Integrations_EventProcessorBuilder_PrivateAttributes_), which takes any number of attribute names or slash-delimited paths to designated a JSON property within an attribute, such as `/address/street`. If any context has a custom or built-in attribute that matches one of these names, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

You can also mark attributes as private when building the context object by calling [`Private()`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.ContextBuilder.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_ContextBuilder_Private_) after setting the attribute on the context builder.

For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v7.0 (C#)">

```csharp
var context = Context.Builder("context-key-123abc")
    .Set("email", "sandy@example.com")
    .Private("email")
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v6.x (C#)">

```csharp
var user = User.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .Email("sandy@example.com").AsPrivateAttribute()
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When the SDK sends this context back to LaunchDarkly, it removes the `email` attribute.

#### Anonymous contexts in the .NET SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v7.0 (C#)">

```csharp
var context = Context.Builder("context-key-123abc")
    .Anonymous(true)
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v6.x (C#)">

```csharp
var user = User.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .Anonymous(true)
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You still need to generate a unique key for anonymous contexts. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this.
</Details>

### Apex

<Details summary="Expand Apex code sample">

Here's an example of a user:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java">

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder('user-key-123abc')
    .setFirstName('Sandy')
    .setLastName('Smith')
    .setEmail('sandy@example.com')
    .setCustom(new LDValueObject.Builder()
        .set('groups', new LDValueArray.Builder()
            .add(LDValue.of('Google'))
            .add(LDValue.of('Microsoft'))
            .build()
        )
        .build()
    )
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `Builder` is the user's key. The key should uniquely identify each user. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"user-key-123abc"`.

#### Anonymous users in the Apex SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java">

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder('abc123')
    .setAnonymous(true)
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You still need to generate a unique key for anonymous users. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this.

#### Private user attributes in the Apex SDK
---

Optionally, you can configure the Apex SDK to treat some or all user attributes as private user attributes. You can use private user attributes for targeting, but they are redacted from the user data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

In the Apex SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the LaunchDarkly client:

- When creating the `LDConfig` object, you can use `setAllAttributesPrivate(true)`. When you do this, all user attributes, except the key, are redacted before the SDK sends the user to LaunchDarkly.

  Here's how:

  <CodeSample>
  <CSTab label="Java">

  ```java
  LDConfig config = new LDConfig.Builder()
      .setAllAttributesPrivate(true)
      .build();
  ```

  </CSTab>
  </CodeSample>

* You can also define private attribute names on a per-user basis.

  Here's how:

  <CodeSample>
  <CSTab label="Java">

  ```java
  Set<String> privateAttributes = new Set<String>();
  privateAttributes.add('firstName');

  LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder('user-key-123abc')
      .setFirstName('alice')
      .setPrivateAttributeNames(privateAttributes)
      .build();
  ```

  </CSTab>
  </CodeSample>

### C/C++ (server-side)

<Details summary="Expand C/C++ (server-side) code sample">

Here's an example of a user:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
struct LDUser *user = LDUserNew("user-key-123abc");
LDUserSetFirstName(user, "Sandy");
LDUserSetLastName(user, "Smith");
LDUserSetEmail(user, "sandy@example.com");

struct LDJSON *tmp;
struct LDJSON *custom = LDNewObject();
struct LDJSON *groups = LDNewArray();
tmp = LDNewText("Google");
LDArrayPush(groups, tmp);
tmp = LDNewText("Microsoft");
LDArrayPush(groups, tmp);
LDObjectSetKey(custom, "groups", groups);

LDUserSetCustom(user, custom);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `LDUserNew` is the user's key. The key should uniquely identify each user. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"user-key-123abc"`.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
LDUserFree(user);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When you are done with an `LDUser` ensure that you free the structure.

#### Private user attributes in the C/C++ SDK
---

You can optionally configure the C/C++ SDK to treat some or all user attributes as private user attributes. Private user attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the user data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

In the C/C++ SDK there are three ways to define private attributes for the LaunchDarkly client:

- When creating the `LDConfig` object, you can use `LDConfigSetAllAttributesPrivate`. When you do this, all user attributes (except the key) for the user are removed before the SDK sends the user to LaunchDarkly.

For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
LDConfigSetAllAttributesPrivate(config, true);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

* When creating the `LDConfig` object, you can list specific private attributes with `LDConfigAddPrivateAttribute`. If any user has a custom or built-in attribute named in this list, the SDK removes it before sending the user to LaunchDarkly.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
LDConfigAddPrivateAttribute(config, "email");
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

* You can also define private attribute names on a per-user basis. For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
LDUserAddPrivateAttribute(user, "email");
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

#### Anonymous users in the C/C++ SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
LDUserSetAnonymous(user, true);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You still need to generate a unique key for anonymous users. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this.

### Erlang

<Details summary="Expand Erlang code sample">

Here's an example of a context:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Erlang SDK v2.0">

```erlang
    Context = ldclient_context:set(<<"name">>, <<"Sandy Smith">>,
        ldclient_context:set(<<"email">>, <<"sandy@example.com">>,
        ldclient_context:set(<<"group">>, [<<"microsoft">>, <<"google">>],
        ldclient_context:new(<<"user-key">>, <<"user">>)))),
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Erlang SDK v1.x">

```erlang
Map = #{
    key => <<"user-key-123abc">>,
    secondary => <<"secondary-123abc">>,
    ip => <<"198.51.100.0">>,
    country => <<"Canada">>,
    email => <<"sandy@example.com">>,
    first_name => <<"Sandy">>,
    last_name => <<"Smith">>,
    avatar => <<"avatar-123abc">>,
    name => <<"Sandy Smith">>,
    anonymous => false,
    <<"custom-key">> => <<"custom-value">>
},
User = ldclient_user:new_from_map(Map)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The `key` property is the context's key. The key is the only mandatory context attribute. The combination of key and kind should uniquely identify each context. You can set the kind, or, if you do not set it, LaunchDarkly assumes that the context kind is "user". You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"user-key-123abc"`.

#### Anonymous contexts in the Erlang SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how to create anonymous contexts in the Erlang SDK:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Erlang SDK v2.0">

```erlang
    Context = ldclient_context:set(anonymous, true,
        ldclient_context:new(<<"user-key-123abc">>))
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Erlang SDK v1.x">

```erlang
Key = <<"user-key-123abc">>,
Anonymous = true,
Map = #{
    key => Key,
    anonymous => Anonymous,
},
User = ldclient_user:new_from_map(Map)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You must still generate a unique key for anonymous contexts. We recommend using Session IDs or UUIDs.

#### Private attributes in the Erlang SDK
---

You can configure the Erlang SDK to treat some or all context attributes as [private attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes). You can use private attributes to target contexts without sending data associated with that context back to LaunchDarkly.

When you create the Options map, use the `private_attributes` key to set private context attributes. When you do this, the SDK does not send the context attributes you specify to LaunchDarkly.

<Callout>
<CalloutTitle>The SDK always sends the context key and kind</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The context key is not optional. You cannot set either the context key or the context kind as a private attribute.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here's how to set context attributes as private for all contexts:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Erlang">

```erlang
ldclient:start_instance("sdk-key-123abc", your_instance, #{private_attributes => [email]})
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Here's how to set context attributes as private for a specific context:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Erlang">

```erlang
    ContextWithPrivateAttributes = ldclient_context:set_private_attributes([<<"name">>, <<"/address/street">>],
        ldclient_context:set(<<"name">>, <<"Global Health Services">>,
        ldclient_context:set(<<"email">>, <<"info@globalhealthexample.com">>,
        ldclient_context:set(<<"address">>, #{
            <<"street">> => <<"123 Main Street">>,
            <<"city">> => <<"Springfield">>
        },
    ldclient_context:new(<<"context-key-456def">>, <<"organization">>))))),
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

In the example, only the `name` and `/address/street` attributes are private for this context.

</Details>

### Go

<Details summary="Expand Go code sample">

The Go SDK defines a `Context` struct and a `Builder`.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v6.0">

```go
import (
    "github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common/v3/ldcontext"
    "github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common/v3/ldvalue"
)

// Context with only a key
// by default, the context kind is "user"
context1 := ldcontext.New("context-key-123abc")

// Context with a key plus other attributes
context2 := ldcontext.NewBuilder("context-key-456def").
    Kind("organization").
    Name("Global Health Services").
    SetString("email", "info@globalhealthexample.com").
    SetValue("address", ldvalue.ObjectBuild().
        SetString("street", "123 Main Street").
        SetString("city", "Springfield")).
    Build()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v5.x">

```go
import (
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common.v2/lduser"
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common.v2/ldvalue"  // for custom attributes read below
)

// User with only a key
user1 := lduser.NewUser("user-key-123abc")

// User with a key plus other attributes
user2 := lduser.NewUserBuilder("user-key-456def").
    FirstName("Sandy").
    LastName("Smith").
    Email("sandy@example.com").
    Custom("groups", ldvalue.ArrayOf(
        ldvalue.String("Google"), ldvalue.String("Microsoft"))).
    Build()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The most common attribute is the context's key. In this case we used the strings `"context-key-123abc"` and `"context-key-456def"`. The key is the only mandatory context attribute. The combination of the key and kind should also uniquely identify each context. You can set the kind, or, if you do not set it, LaunchDarkly assumes that the context kind is "user". You can use a primary key, a hash, or some other value, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible.

To learn more about the available attributes, read [`Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common/v3@v3.0.0/ldcontext#Context) and [`Builder`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common/v3@v3.0.0/ldcontext#Builder).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Interpreting attribute types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The kind and name attributes expect string values. Other attribute values can be booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, or JSON objects. These types are all represented by the [`ldvalue.Value`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common/v3@v3.0.0/ldvalue#Value) type. The Go SDK is strongly-typed, so be aware of this distinction.

If an attribute is a JSON object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

#### Private attributes in the Go SDK
---

You can optionally configure the Go SDK to treat some or all context attributes as [private attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes). You can use private context attributes for targeting purposes, but the SDK removes private context attributes from the data it sends to LaunchDarkly.

In the Go SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the entire LaunchDarkly client:

- You can set the configuration option `AllAttributesPrivate` to true. If you enable this, the SDK removes all attributes for all contexts before it sends the context to LaunchDarkly, except the key and kind.
- You can set the configuration option `PrivateAttributes` to a list of attribute names. If any context has an attribute named in this list, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

Here's how to to define private attributes:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v6.0">

```go
import (
    ld "github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6"
    "github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6/ldcomponents"
)

var config ld.Config

// Make all attributes private for all contexts
config.Events = ldcomponents.SendEvents().AllAttributesPrivate(true)

// Or, make just the email and address attributes private for all contexts
config.Events = ldcomponents.SendEvents().
    PrivateAttributes("name", "email")
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v5.x">

```go
import (
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5"
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents"
)

var config ld.Config

// Make all attributes private for all users
config.Events = ldcomponents.SendEvents().AllAttributesPrivate(true)

// Or, make just the name and email attributes private for all users
config.Events = ldcomponents.SendEvents().
    PrivateAttributeNames(lduser.NameAttribute, lduser.EmailAttribute)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also define a set of private attributes on the context object itself. In the following example, "email" and the "street" field of the "address" attribute are private for this context, in addition to any private attributes that were specified globally:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v6.0">

```go
import (
    "github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common/v3/ldcontext"
)

context := ldcontext.NewBuilder("context-key-123abc").
    Kind("organization").
    Name("Global Health Services").
    SetString("email", "info@globalhealthexample.com").
    SetValue("address", ldvalue.ObjectBuild().
        SetString("street", "123 Main Street").
        SetString("city", "Springfield")).
    Private("email").
    Private("/address/street").
    Build()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

#### Anonymous contexts in the Go SDK
---

You can distinguish anonymous contexts in the SDK. Anonymous contexts are only intended for flag evaluations and are not indexed by LaunchDarkly. Anonymous contexts do not appear on the **Contexts** list. However, they are not excluded from event data, so setting a context as anonymous is not the same as setting its attributes as private. To learn more, read [Anonymous contexts](/home/contexts/anonymous-contexts).

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v6.0">

```go
import (
    "github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common/v3/ldcontext"
)

// Anonymous context with only a key
context1 := ldcontext.NewBuilder("context-key-123abc").Anonymous(true)

// Anonymous context with a key plus other attributes
context2 := ldcontext.NewBuilder("context-key-456def").
    Anonymous(true).
    SetString("country", "Canada").
    Build()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v5.x">

```go
import (
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common.v2/lduser"
)

// Anonymous user with only a key
user1 := lduser.NewAnonymousUser("user-key-123abc")

// Anonymous user with a key plus other attributes
user2 := lduser.NewUserBuilder("user-key-456def").
    Anonymous(true).
    Country("US").
    Build()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You still need to generate a unique key for anonymous contexts. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this.

### Haskell

<Details summary="Expand Haskell code sample">

Here's an example of a context:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Haskell SDK v4.0">

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import LaunchDarkly.Server.Context

import Data.Function ((&))

-- Context with key and kind
context1 :: Context
context1 = makeContext "context-key-123abc" "user"

-- Context with a key plus other attributes
context2 :: Context
context2 = makeContext "context-key-456def" "organization"
    & withAttribute "name" "Global Health Services"
    & withAttribute "email" "info@globalhealthexample.com"
    & withAttribute "address" $ Object $ fromList [("street", "123 Main St"), ("city", "Springfield")]
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Haskell SDK v3.x">

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import LaunchDarkly.Server.User

import Data.Function ((&))

-- User with only a key
user1 :: User
user1 = (makeUser "user-key-123abc")

user2 :: User
user2 = (makeUser "user-key-456def")
    & setFirstName "Sandy"
    & setLastName "Smith"
    & setEmail "sandy@example.com"
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `makeUser` is the context's key. The key is the only mandatory attribute. The combination of the key and kind should uniquely identify each context. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same end user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"user-key-123abc"`.

#### Private attributes in the Haskell SDK
---

Optionally, you can configure the Haskell SDK to treat some or all context attributes as [private attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes). You can use private context attributes for targeting purposes, but the SDK removes private context attributes from the data it sends to LaunchDarkly.

When you create the `Config` object, use `configSetAllAttributesPrivate` to set all context attributes as private. When you do this, all context attributes, except the key and kind, are removed before the SDK sends the context to LaunchDarkly.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Haskell">

```haskell
makeConfig "sdk-key" & configSetAllAttributesPrivate True
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When you create the `Config` object, you can list specific private attributes with `configSetPrivateAttributeNames`. If any context has attributes named in this list, the SDK removes them before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Haskell">

```haskell
import qualified Data.Set as S
import qualified LaunchDarkly.Server.Reference as R

makeConfig sdkKey
  & configSetAllAttributesPrivate True
  & configSetPrivateAttributeNames (S.fromList $ map R.makeLiteral ["name", "email"])
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also define private attribute names on a per-context basis.

For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Haskell SDK v4.0">

```haskell
makeContext "key" "user"
  & withName "Sandy"
  & withAttribute "email" "sandy@example.com"
  & withPrivateAttributes (S.fromList $ map R.makeLiteral ["name", "email"])
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Haskell SDK v3.x">

```haskell
import Data.Set (fromList)

user' = userSetPrivateAttributeNames (fromList ["name", "email"]) user
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

#### Anonymous contexts in the Haskell SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Haskell SDK v4.0">

```haskell
makeContext "user-key-123abc" "user"
  & withAnonymous True
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Haskell SDK v3.x">

```haskell
user` = userSetAnonymous True user
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You still must generate a unique key for anonymous contexts. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this.
</Details>

### Java

<Details summary="Expand Java code sample">

In the Java SDK, use a [builder pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) to construct contexts.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java SDK v6.0">

```java
LDContext context = LDContext.builder("context-key-123abc")
  .set("firstName", "Sandy")
  .set("lastName", "Smith")
  .set("email", "sandy@example.com")
  .set("groups",
    LDValue.buildArray().add("Google").add("Microsoft").build())
  .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Java SDK v5.x">

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder("user-key-123abc")
  .firstName("Sandy")
  .lastName("Smith")
  .email("sandy@example.com")
  .custom("groups",
    LDValue.buildArray().add("Google").add("Microsoft").build())
  .build()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `Builder` is the context's key. The key should uniquely identify each context. You can use a primary key or a hash, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"context-key-123abc"`.

Our Javadoc for [ContextBuilder](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.launchdarkly/launchdarkly-java-server-sdk/latest/com/launchdarkly/sdk/ContextBuilder.html) shows you all the attributes that LaunchDarkly supports by default.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Interpreting custom attribute types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The optional name and kind attributes expect string values. If the "kind" attribute is not specified, it is assumed to be "user." Other attribute values can be booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, or objects. If you pass a value that looks like a number or a boolean, the SDK interprets it that way. The Java SDK is strongly-typed, so be aware of this distinction.

If an attribute is a JSON object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

#### Private context attributes in the Java SDK
---

You can optionally configure the Java SDK to treat some or all attributes as [private context attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes). Private context attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the context data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

In the Java SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the entire LaunchDarkly client:

- When creating the `LDConfig` object, you can call the [`allAttributesPrivate`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.launchdarkly/launchdarkly-java-server-sdk/latest/com/launchdarkly/sdk/server/integrations/EventProcessorBuilder.html#allAttributesPrivate) method, which takes in a boolean parameter. If `true`, all context attributes except the key for all contexts are removed before the SDK sends the context to LaunchDarkly.
- When creating the `LDConfig` object, you can call the [`privateAttributes`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.launchdarkly/launchdarkly-java-server-sdk/latest/com/launchdarkly/sdk/server/integrations/EventProcessorBuilder.html#privateAttributes) method, which takes in a set of custom or built-in attributes as a parameter. If any context has a custom or built-in attribute named in this list, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

Here's how to define private attributes:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java SDK v6.0">

```java
LDConfig configWithAllAttributesPrivate = new LDConfig.Builder()
  .events(
    Components.sendEvents()
      .allAttributesPrivate(true)
  )
  .build();

LDConfig configWithSpecificAttributesPrivate = new LDConfig.Builder()
  .events(
    Components.sendEvents()
      .privateAttributes("name", "email", "someAttribute")
  )
  .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Java SDK v5.x">

```java
LDConfig configWithAllAttributesPrivate = new LDConfig.Builder()
  .events(
    Components.sendEvents()
      .allAttributesPrivate(true)
  )
  .build();

LDConfig configWithSpecificAttributesPrivate = new LDConfig.Builder()
  .events(
    Components.sendEvents()
      .privateAttributes(UserAttribute.NAME, UserAttribute.EMAIL,
        UserAttribute.forName("someCustomAttribute"))
  )
  .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also mark attributes as private when building the context object by calling the `privateAttributes` builder method. For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java SDK v6.0">

```java
LDContext context = LDContext.builder("context-key-123abc")
  .set("email", "sandy@example.com")
  .privateAttributes("email")
  .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Java SDK v5.x">

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder("user-key-123abc")
  .privateEmail("sandy@example.com")
  .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When the SDK sends this context back to LaunchDarkly, it removes the `email` attribute.

#### Anonymous users in the Java SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java SDK v6.0">

```java
LDContext context = LDContext.builder("context-key-123abc")
  .anonymous(true)
  .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Java SDK v5.x">

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder("user-key-123abc")
  .anonymous(true)
  .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You still need to generate a unique key for anonymous users. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this.

### Lua

<Details summary="Expand Lua code sample">

Here's an example of a user:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Lua">

```lua
local user = ld.makeUser({
    key       = "user-key-123abc",
    firstName = "Sandy",
    lastName  = "Smith",
    email     = "sandy@example.com",
    custom    = {
        groups = { "Google", "Microsoft" }
    }
})
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `ld.makeUser` is the user's key. The key should uniquely identify each user. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"user-key-123abc"`.

### Node.js (server-side)


<Details summary="Expand Node.js (server-side) code sample">

In the Node.js SDK, contexts are JSON objects.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v7.0 (JavaScript)">

```js
const context = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  firstName: 'Sandy',

};
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v7.0 (TypeScript)">

```ts
import * as ld from 'launchdarkly-node-server-sdk';

const context: ld.LDContext = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  firstName: 'Sandy',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',
  groups: ['Google', 'Microsoft'],
};
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Node.js v6.x and earlier (JavaScript)">

```js
const user = {

In the Node.js SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the entire LaunchDarkly client:

- In the LaunchDarkly `LDOptions`, you can set `allAttributesPrivate` to `true`. If you enable this, the SDK removes all attributes for all contexts before sending the context to LaunchDarkly, except the kind and key.
- In the LaunchDarkly `LDOptions` object, you can define a list of `privateAttributes`. If any context has a custom or built-in attribute named in this list, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

You can also define a set of `privateAttributes` on the context object. For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v7.0 (JavaScript)">

```js
const context = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'user-key-123abc',
  email: 'sandy@example.com',

</CodeSample>

When the SDK sends this context back to LaunchDarkly, it removes the `email` attribute.

#### Anonymous contexts in the Node.js SDK

### PHP

<Details summary="Expand PHP code sample">

In the PHP SDK, use a [builder pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) to construct contexts.

The first argument to [`LDContextBuilder`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/php-server-sdk/classes/LaunchDarkly-LDContextBuilder.html) is the context's key. The key should uniquely identify each context. You can use a primary key or a hash, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible.

In the PHP SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the entire LaunchDarkly client:

* In the LaunchDarkly `config`, you can set `all_attributes_private` to `true`. If you enable this, the SDK removes all attributes except the key and kind from a context before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.
* In the LaunchDarkly `config` object, you can define a list of `private_attribute_names`. If any context has a custom or built-in attribute named in this list, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

You can also mark attributes as private when building the context object by calling the equivalent "private" [`LDContextBuilder`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/php-server-sdk/classes/LaunchDarkly-LDContextBuilder.html) method.

For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="PHP SDK v5.0">

```php
$context = LDContext::builder('context-key-123abc')
    ->set('email', 'sandy@example.com')

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When the SDK sends this context back to LaunchDarkly, it removes the `email` attribute.

#### Anonymous contexts in the PHP SDK

### Python

<Details summary="Expand Python code sample">

In version 8.0 and higher of the Python SDK, the [`Context`](https://launchdarkly-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-main.html#ldclient.Context) class has a `create` method for creating a simple context, with a context kind of "user" and with only a key. It has a `builder` method for building a context with other properties.

    "email": "sandy@example.com",
    "custom": {
      "groups": ["Google", "Microsoft"]
    }
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The argument to `Context.builder` is the context's key. The key should uniquely identify each context. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. In this example the hash is `"context-key-123abc"`.

<CalloutTitle>Interpreting custom attribute types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The optional name and kind attributes expect string values. If the "kind" attribute is not specified, it is assumed to be "user." Other attribute values can be booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, or objects.

If an attribute is a JSON object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

#### Private context attributes in the Python SDK
---

You can optionally configure the Python SDK to treat some or all attributes as [private context attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes). Private context attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the context data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

In the Python SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the LaunchDarkly client:

- In the LaunchDarkly `config`, you can set `all_attributes_private` to true. If you enable this, the SDK removes all context attributes for all contexts before sending the context to LaunchDarkly, except the key.
- In the LaunchDarkly `config` object, you can define a list of attributes in `private_attributes`. If any context has a custom or built-in attribute named in this list, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

You can also mark attributes as private when building the context object by calling the `private` builder method. For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Python SDK v8.0">

```python
context = Context.builder("context-key-123abc") \
    .set("email", "sandy@example.com") \
    .private("email") \
    .build()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Python SDK v7.x">

```python
user = {
    "key": "user-key-123abc",
    "email": "sandy@example.com",
    "privateAttributeNames": ["email"]
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When the SDK sends this context back to LaunchDarkly, it removes the `email` attribute.

#### Anonymous users in the Python SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Python SDK v8.0">

```python
context = Context.builder("context-key-123abc").anonymous(True).build()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Python SDK v7.x">

```python
user = { "key":"user-key-123abc", "anonymous": True }
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You still need to generate a unique key for anonymous contexts. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this. Anonymous contexts still count toward your plan's MAU limit, so make sure you capture and reuse your anonymous context keys between requests.

### Ruby

<Details summary="Expand Ruby code sample">

In the Ruby SDK, contexts are instances of `LaunchDarkly::LDContext`. Legacy users can continue to be provided as simple hashes.

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Ruby SDK v7.0">

```ruby
context = LaunchDarkly::LDContext.create({
    key: "user-key-123abc",
    kind: "user",
    firstName: "Sandy",
    lastName: "Smith",
    email: "sandy@example.com",
    groups: ["Google", "Microsoft"]
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Ruby SDK v6.x">

```ruby
user = {
    key: "user-key-123abc",
    firstName: "Sandy",
    lastName: "Smith",
    email: "sandy@example.com",
    custom: {
      groups: ["Google", "Microsoft"]
    }
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The `key` property is the context's key. The key should uniquely identify each context. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash string, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash string if possible. In this example the hash string is `"user-key-123abc"`.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Context attribute keys must be symbols</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

All context attribute keys, for both built-in and custom attributes, must be symbols and not strings.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Interpreting custom attribute types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The optional name and kind attributes expect string values. If the "kind" attribute is not specified, it is assumed to be "user" and the hash is assumed to be in the legacy user format. Other attribute values can be booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, or objects. If you enter a custom value on the **Contexts** list that looks like a number or a boolean, the SDK interprets it that way.

If an attribute is a JSON object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

- In the LaunchDarkly config object, you can define a list of `private_attributes`. If any context has a custom or built-in attribute named in this list, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

You can also define a set of `privateAttributes` on the context object. For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Ruby SDK v7.0">

```ruby
context = LaunchDarkly::LDContext.create({
  key: "user-key-123abc",
  kind: "user",
  firstName: "Sandy",
  lastName: "Smith",
  email: "sandy@example.com",
  groups: ["Google", "Microsoft"],
  _meta: {
    privateAttributes: ['email']
  }
})
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Ruby SDK v6.x">

```ruby
user = {
  key: "user-key-123abc",
  firstName: "Sandy",
  lastName: "Smith",
  email: "sandy@example.com",
  custom: {
    groups: ["Google", "Microsoft"]
  },
  privateAttributeNames: ['email']
}
```

</CSTab>

```

</CSTab>

user = { key: "user-key-123abc", anonymous: true }
```

</CSTab>

### Rust

<Details summary="Expand Rust code sample">

The Rust SDK defines a [`Context`](https://docs.rs/launchdarkly-server-sdk/latest/launchdarkly_server_sdk/struct.Context.html) struct and a [`ContextBuilder`](https://docs.rs/launchdarkly-server-sdk/latest/launchdarkly_server_sdk/struct.ContextBuilder.html).

Here's an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Rust SDK v1">

```rust
// Context with only a key
let context = ContextBuilder::new("context-key-123abc").build()?;

// Context with a key plus other attributes
let custom = hashmap! {
    "groups".into() => vec!["Google", "Microsoft"].into(),
};
let context = ContextBuilder::new("context-key-123abc")
    .set_value("first_name", "Sandy".into())
    .set_value("last_name", "Smith".into())
    .set_value("email", "sandy@example.com".into())
    .set_value("Google", "groups".into())
    .set_value("Microsoft", "groups".into())
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Rust SDK beta">

```rust
// User with only a key
let user = UserBuilder::new("user-key-123abc").build()?;

// User with a key plus other attributes
let custom = hashmap! {
    "groups".into() => vec!["Google", "Microsoft"].into(),
};
let mut builder = User::with_key("user-key-123abc");
builder.first_name("Sandy");
builder.last_name("Smith");
builder.email("sandy@example.com");
builder.custom(custom);
let user2 = builder.build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The most common attribute is the context's key. In the example, the string `"context-key-123abc"` is the context key. The context key is the only mandatory context attribute. The combination of the key and kind should also uniquely identify each context. You can set the kind, or, if you do not set it, LaunchDarkly assumes that the context kind is "user". For the context key, you can use a primary key, a hash string, or some other value, as long as the same context always has the same key. We recommend using a hash string if possible.

To learn more about the available attributes, read [`Context`](https://docs.rs/launchdarkly-server-sdk/latest/launchdarkly_server_sdk/struct.Context.html) and [`ContextBuilder`](https://docs.rs/launchdarkly-server-sdk/latest/launchdarkly_server_sdk/struct.ContextBuilder.html).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Interpreting custom attribute types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The optional name and kind attributes, which you can set with `.name()` and `.kind()`, expect string values. Other attribute values can be any JSON type, including booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, or objects. These types are all represented by the [`AttributeValue`](https://docs.rs/launchdarkly-server-sdk/latest/launchdarkly_server_sdk/enum.AttributeValue.html) type. The Rust SDK is strongly-typed, so be aware of this distinction.

If an attribute is an object, then in your flag or segment targeting, you can use `/` as a delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, if you have an "address" attribute that includes several fields, then you could use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

#### Private attributes in the Rust SDK
---

You can optionally configure the Rust SDK to treat some or all attributes as [Private attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes). You can use private attributes for targeting purposes, but the SDK removes them from the user data it sends back to LaunchDarkly.

In the Rust SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the entire LaunchDarkly client:

- In the LaunchDarkly config object, you can set `all_attributes_private` to true. If you enable this, the SDK removes all attributes for all contexts before sending the context to LaunchDarkly, except the key and kind.
- In the LaunchDarkly config object, you can define a list of `private_attributes`. If any contexts has an attribute named in this list, the SDK removes it before sending the context to LaunchDarkly.

You can also define private attributes on the context object. For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Rust SDK v1">

```rust
let context = ContextBuilder::new("context-key-123abc")
    .set_value("email", "youremail@example.com".into())
    .add_private_attribute(Reference::new("email"))
    .build()?;
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Rust SDK beta">

```rust
let user = User::with_key("user-key-123abc")
    .name("Sandy")
    .private_attributes(
        vec!["email".into()]
            .into_iter()
            .collect(),
    )
    .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When the SDK sends this context back to LaunchDarkly, it removes the `email` attribute.


#### Anonymous contexts in the Rust SDK
---

If your application has both anonymous and logged-in states, you can distinguish logged-in end users from anonymous end users in the SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Rust SDK v1">

```rust
// Anonymous context with only a key
let context = ContextBuilder::new("context-key-123abc").anonymous(true).build();

// Anonymous context with a key plus other attributes
let context = ContextBuilder::new("context-key-123abc").
    anonymous(true).
    set_value("country", "US".into()).
    build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Rust SDK beta">

```rust
// Anonymous user with a key plus other attributes
let user = User::with_key("user-key-123abc").

// Anonymous user with a key plus other attributes
let user = User::with_key("user-key-123abc").
    anonymous(true).
    country("US").
    build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You still need to generate a unique key for anonymous contexts. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this.
