## Overview

This topic explains how to use the identify feature in LaunchDarkly SDKs. Identify is available for both client-side and server-side SDKs.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Newer versions of LaunchDarkly SDKs replace users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. To learn more, read [Contexts](/home/contexts).

Creating contexts and evaluating flags based on them is supported in the latest major versions of [some of our SDKs](/sdk). For these SDKs, the code samples on this page include the two most recent versions.

You can upgrade your SDKs at any time, but the ability to target by context, or review context instances that have encountered flags in your application, is only available for customers in the contexts Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access to this feature, [join the EAP](https://launchdarkly.com/eap).

If you are using the latest version of an SDK and are not part of the EAP, your application can send contexts to LaunchDarkly and they will appear on the **Users** list.

</CalloutDescription>

## Using identify to change contexts and users

The identify feature's behavior differs between client-side and server-side SDKs.

Client-side SDKs are configured to operate for one end user at a time, identified or anonymous. In these SDKs, the identify feature allows customers to change the context or user such as when an end user logs in or changes their settings. Identifying contexts and users causes LaunchDarkly to index them.

Server-side SDKs operate for multiple end users concurrently. Unlike in client-side SDKs, server-side SDKs do not have a notion of "changing the user context" because contexts or users are directly passed to client method invocations for actions such as evaluating flag variations. In server-side SDKs, the only impact of identifying contexts and users is that they are added to the **Contexts** and **Users** lists, respectively. However, in most applications this is not needed because they are automatically indexed when used for a flag evaluation. Instead, you should provide the evaluation object in a variation or all flags call to get the expected flag evaluation. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating) and [Getting all flags](/sdk/features/all-flags).

To learn more about the differences in how SDKs identify and use users and contexts, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

Details about each SDK's identify feature are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [.NET (client-side)](#net-client-side)
* [Android](#android)
* [C/C++ (client-side)](#cc-client-side)
* [Electron](#electron)
* [Flutter](#flutter)
* [iOS](#ios)
* [JavaScript](#javascript)
* [Node.js (client-side)](#nodejs-client-side)
* [React](#react)
* [React Native](#react-native)
* [Roku](#roku)

### .NET (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (client-side) code sample">

You can use the `Identify` or `IdentifyAsync` method to switch contexts. This loads any saved flag values for the next context, and tells the client to change the current context and obtain the feature flag values for the new context.

In some situations, the new context may be an updated version of the existing context. For example, on a sign-in page in a single-page app, you could represent the same person as an anonymous user before they log in, and a different user after they log in. After the person logs in, you can call `Identify()` or `IdentifyAsync()` so that the person receives the correct feature flag settings for their account.

In other situations, the new context may be a multi-context, that is, a set of several different contexts that you want to evaluate together. For example, as soon as an end user visits your app, you may initialize the client with a context using a context kind of "device." When the end user logs in, you now also have their user and organization information. You can call `Identify()` with a multi-context that contains the "device," "user," and "organization" contexts for the end user.

You may want to wait until the flag values for the new context have been loaded before proceeding. You can do this either by calling the synchronous method `Identify` with a timeout, or by calling the asynchronous method `IdentifyAsync` and awaiting the result.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v3.0 (C#)">

```csharp
var updatedContext = Context.Builder("context-key-123abc")
    .Set("email", "sandy@example.com")
    .Build();

// Synchronous method
client.Identify(updatedContext, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

// Asynchronous method
await client.IdentifyAsync(updatedContext);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v2.x (C#)">

```csharp
var updatedUser = LDUser.Builder("user-key-123abc")
    .Email("sandy@example.com")
    .Build();

// Synchronous method
client.Identify(updatedUser, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

// Asynchronous method
await client.IdentifyAsync(updatedUser);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

### Android

<Details summary="Expand Android code sample">

The `identify()` method tells the client to change the current context and obtain the feature flag values for the new context.

In some situations, the new context may be an updated version of the existing context. For example, on a sign-in page in a single-page app, you could represent the same person as an anonymous user before they log in, and a different user after they log in. You can initialize the client with an anonymous context with a context kind of "user." After the person logs in, you can update the user context and call `identify()` so that the person receives the correct feature flag settings for their account.

In other situations, the new context may be a multi-context, that is, a set of several different contexts that you want to evaluate together. For example, as soon as an end user visits your app, you may initialize the client with a context using a context kind of "device." When the end user logs in, you now also have their user and organization information. You can call `identify()` with a multi-context that contains the "device," "user," and "organization" contexts for the end user.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v4.0 (Java)">

```java
LDContext updatedContext = LDContext.builderFromContext(context)
    .email("sandy@example.com")
    .build();

client.identify(updatedContext);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v4.0 (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val updatedContext: LDContext = LDContext.builderFromContext(context)
    .email("sandy@example.com")
    .build()

client.identify(updatedContext)
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v3.x (Java)">

```java
LDUser updatedUser = new LDUser.Builder(user)
    .email("sandy@example.com")
    .build();

client.identify(updatedUser);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Android SDK v3.x (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val updatedUser: LDUser = LDUser.Builder(user)
    .email("sandy@example.com")
    .build()

client.identify(updatedUser)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The `identify()` call loads any saved flag values for the new user context and immediately triggers an update of the latest flags from LaunchDarkly.

`identify()` returns a [Future](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Future) to indicate completion. If you want to be sure subsequent code is using the latest values from the server, you can wait for the Future using `get`.

You can use the `LDClientIdentify` method to switch users:

<CodeSample>

```c
LDClientIdentify(client, newUser);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The `LDClientIdentify()` call loads any saved flag values for the new user and immediately trigger an update of the latest flags from LaunchDarkly. Because this method re-fetches flag settings for the new user, you should should not call it at high frequency. The intended use case for switching user contexts is the login/logout flow.

When the end user logs in, you now also have their user and organization information. You can call `identify()` with a multi-context that contains the "device," "user," and "organization" contexts for the end user.

If the client app does not identify an `LDContext`, `LDClient` creates an anonymous default context, which can affect which feature flags LaunchDarkly delivers to the `LDClient`. Client apps should follow the [Apple Privacy Policy](https://apple.com/legal/privacy) when collecting end user information.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="iOS SDK v8.0 (Swift)">

```swift
let newContext = try LDContextBuilder(key: "context-key-123abc").build().get();

// You can also call identify with a completion

if (result.success) {
    LDContext *context = result.success;
}
[[LDClient get] identifyWithContext:newContext];

// You can also call identify with a completion
[[LDClient get] identifyWithContext:newContext completion:^() {
    // Flags have been retrieved for the new context

`Identify` creates or updates contexts on LaunchDarkly, which makes them available for targeting and autocomplete on the **Contexts** list.

In most cases, you do not need to call `Identify`. The `Variation` methods automatically create contexts on the **Contexts** list for you. `Identify` is useful if you want to pre-populate your **Contexts** list before you launch any features.

To use `Identify`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v7.0 (C#)">

```csharp
client.Identify(context);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label=".NET SDK v6.x (C#)">

Variation methods like `boolVariation` or `stringVariation` do not automatically generate `index` events due to limitations with the Apex platform. This means that the SDK does not automatically populate the **Users** list.

We recommend calling `client.identify(user)` with each of your users to generate user indexing events and populate your **Users** list.
