## Overview

This topic explains how to use the flush feature. The flush feature is available on both server-side and client-side SDKs.

All LaunchDarkly SDKs automatically flush pending analytics events to LaunchDarkly at regular intervals. This prevents the SDK from having to send constant network requests. The time between intervals varies by SDK, and is configurable. To learn how to configure your SDK's flush interval, read [Configuration](/sdk/features/config).

You can manually call flush to send events immediately without waiting for the next interval. Most customers do not need to use the flush feature because SDKs automatically flush their pending analytics events on a periodic frequency. However, it can be useful if you are using the SDK in a short-lived serverless process or a test application, rather than in a long-running application. To learn more, read [Analytics events](/sdk/concepts/events).

## Using the flush feature

The flush feature tells the client to send all of an SDK's pending analytics events to LaunchDarkly as soon as possible.

All SDKs support asynchronous flushing, which tells the SDK to start delivering events, but returns control to the application before delivery is complete. Some SDKs also support synchronous flushing, which tells the SDK to deliver the events and not return control until delivery is complete.

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

* [.NET (client-side)](#net-client-side)
* [Android](#android)
* [C/C++ (client-side)](#cc-client-side)

### .NET (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (client-side) code sample">

Internally, the client-side .NET SDK keeps an event buffer for `Track` and `Identify` calls. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. If you test the SDK in a REPL, you may want to manually call `Flush` to process events immediately.

The flush interval is configurable. If you need to change the interval, you can do so with the `Configuration` class.

To call `flush`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
client.Flush();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
</Details>

### Android

<Details summary="Expand Android code sample">

The Android SDK keeps an internal event buffer for analytics calls. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. You can configure the flush interval if needed.

In some situations, such as when you're testing the SDK in a simulator, you may want to manually call `flush` to request any queued events to be sent immediately. This call is non-blocking, so it returns before the events are sent.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java">

```java
client.flush();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
client.flush()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The flush interval is configurable.

### C/C++ (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand C/C++ (server-side) code sample">

The LaunchDarkly SDK keeps an internal event buffer for analytics events. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. In some situations, for example, if you're testing the SDK in a simulator, you may want to manually call flush to process events immediately.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
LDClientFlush(client);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The flush interval is configurable. If you need to change the interval, you can do so via the configuration.

### .NET (server-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (server-side) code sample">

The .NET (server-side) SDK supports asynchronous flushing with the [`Flush`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.LdClient.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_LdClient_Flush_) method.

To call `flush`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
client.Flush();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Starting in version 7.0.0, the SDK also supports synchronous flushing with the [`FlushAndWait`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.LdClient.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_LdClient_FlushAndWait_System_TimeSpan_) method. In this example, the `TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2)` value means that the application is willing to wait no more than two seconds for event delivery.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
client.FlushAndWait(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The flush interval is configurable. If you need to change the interval, you can do so with the `Configuration` class.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
var config = Configuration.Builder("sdk-key-123abc")
    .Events(
        Components.SendEvents().FlushInterval(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))
    )
    .Build();
var client = new LdClient(config);

```

### PHP

<Details summary="Expand PHP code sample">

Internally, the LaunchDarkly SDK keeps an event buffer for `variation`, `track`, and `identify` calls. These are automatically flushed when the LDClient is destroyed. PHP's shared-nothing architecture means manual invocation of this method is typically not needed. Developers may do so if they wish to flush events prior to teardown.

<CSTab label="PHP">

```php
ldclient->flush();
