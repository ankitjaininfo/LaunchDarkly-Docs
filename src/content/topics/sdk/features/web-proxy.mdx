## Overview

This topic explains how to configure an SDK to connect to LaunchDarkly through a web proxy. This feature is available for both client-side and server-side SDKs.

Connecting to LaunchDarkly through a web proxy is not related to using LaunchDarkly's Relay Proxy. To learn about LaunchDarkly's Relay Proxy, read [The Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy).

## Connecting though a web proxy

If your organization requires that you use a web proxy to connect to external resources, you must configure your LaunchDarkly SDKs to connect through the proxy instead of connecting to LaunchDarkly directly.

Some proxies require authentication with a username and password, or with custom headers. Instructions on how to configure the SDK to send these parameters are in the SDK-specific sections.

In the following examples, the web proxy's hostname is "my-proxy-host" and it uses port 8080. Substitute the appropriate values for your proxy. Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below:

* [Client-side SDKs](#client-side-sdks)
* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

<CalloutTitle>Using a web proxy with mobile SDKs</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Android, Flutter, iOS, and React Native support using a web proxy through their device operating systems (OS). You can use their onboard OS settings to configure a web proxy.

### Apex

<Details summary="Expand Apex code sample">

The Apex bridge that provides and retrieves flag values is written in Go, and uses the default Go networking mechanisms.Â 

Go's standard HTTP library recognizes the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`. If you set these variables, the SDK will connect through a web proxy at the URL you provide. Because the LaunchDarkly services have `https:` URLs, you use `HTTPS_PROXY`. If you are connecting to services at an insecure `http:` URL use `HTTP_PROXY` instead.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Console">

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://my-proxy-host:8080
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="cmd">

```batch
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://my-proxy-host:8080
```

</CSTab>

)

var config ld.Config
config.HTTP = ldcomponents.HTTPConfiguration().
    ProxyURL("https://my-proxy-host:8080")
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v5.x">

```go
import (
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5"
