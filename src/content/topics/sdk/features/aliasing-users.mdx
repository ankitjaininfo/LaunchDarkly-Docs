<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>This feature is deprecated in the contexts EAP</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly no longer supports `alias` events for SDKs included in the contexts Early Access Program (EAP). LaunchDarkly continues to support sending and receiving alias events for older SDK versions, and SDKs not included in the EAP. For a list of SDKs in the contexts EAP, read about our [SDKs that support contexts](/sdk).

To learn how to associate contexts without using the `alias` method, read [Associating anonymous contexts with logged-in end users](/home/contexts/anonymous-contexts#associating-anonymous-contexts-with-logged-in-end-users).

## Overview

This topic explains how to alias the users of various LaunchDarkly SDKs. This feature is available for both client-side and server-side SDKs, although its behavior differs between client-side and server-side SDKs.

## Aliased users

There are situations in which multiple LaunchDarkly users can represent one person. For example, this can happen when a person initially logs into an application. The person might be represented by an anonymous user before they log in, and a different user after they log in. In that case, that one person is identified by two different users as denoted by different user keys. Our SDKs can associate these two LaunchDarkly users by sending an `alias` event.

Only some LaunchDarkly SDKs offer the ability to manually send an `alias` event. Some client-side SDKs automatically send an `alias` event when identifying a known user if the previous user was anonymous. You can disable this behavior if necessary. To learn how, read [Configuration](/sdk/features/config).

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below:

* [Client-side SDKs](#client-side-sdks)
* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [.NET (client-side)](#net-client-side)
* [C/C++ (client-side)](#cc-client-side)
* [Electron](#electron)
* [Flutter](#flutter)
* [React Native](#react-native)
* [Roku](#roku)
