## Overview

This topic explains how to adapt code that currently uses a 4.x version of the [iOS client-side SDK](/sdk/client-side/ios) to use version 5.0 or later.

Sections in this topic address different changes and updates between versions 4.x and 5.0 of the SDK.

## Build considerations

The SDK has replaced the internal dependency on the Objective-C eventsource implementation `DarklyEventSource` with a pure Swift implementation `LDSwiftEventSource`. For most methods of integrating the SDK as a dependency of your application this should require no manual intervention. Methods of integrating the SDK that require explicitly referencing the framework products may require manual intervention, some cases of which are:

* Manually integrating the SDK project as a subproject of your application project.
* Using Carthage without a `copy-frameworks` build phase.
* Otherwise manually including the built frameworks for the SDK and its dependencies.

For these cases the `DarklyEventSource` framework products should be removed from your project configuration. The new dependency `LDSwiftEventSource` does not require being manually specified as a dependency when being built as a subproject of your application, but may require being manually included when manually copying built frameworks.

## Initializing the SDK and the shared LDClient instance

In 4.x versions of the iOS SDK a single shared `LDClient` instance was exposed by the static `LDClient.shared` property. This instance was initially unstarted, and configured with a default `LDConfig` and `LDUser`. It would then be reconfigured and started by the application by calling `start` or `startCompleteWhenFlagsReceived` on the shared instance.

In the 5.0 release of the iOS SDK, the `LDClient.shared` property was removed, and `start` is now a static method of the `LDClient` class. To initialize the shared instance(s), `start` is called with the desired SDK configuration and optionally a `LDUser`. After `start` returns, it is safe to retrieve the primary instance with the new `LDClient.get()` static method, or a secondary environment with the `LDClient.getForMobileKey()` static method.

Here is an an example of the `start` method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="sdk4-swift"
  values={[
    { label: '4.x syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk4-swift', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk5-swift', },
    { label: '4.x syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk4-objc', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk5-objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-swift">

```swift
let config = LDConfig(mobileKey: "mobile-key-123abc")
let user = LDUser(key: "user-key-123abc")
LDClient.shared.start(config: config, user: user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-swift">

```swift
let config = LDConfig(mobileKey: "mobile-key-123abc")
let user = LDUser(key: "user-key-123abc")
LDClient.start(config: config, user: user)
// Safe to force get
let shared = LDClient.get()!
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-objc">

```objectivec
LDConfig *config = [[LDConfig alloc] initWithMobileKey:@"mobile-key-123abc"];
LDUser *user = [[LDUser alloc] initWithKey:@"user-key-123abc"];
[[LDClient sharedInstance] startWithConfig:config user:user];
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-objc">

```objectivec
LDConfig *config = [[LDConfig alloc] initWithMobileKey:@"mobile-key-123abc"];
LDUser *user = [[LDUser alloc] initWithKey:@"user-key-123abc"];
[LDClient start:config user:user];
LDClient *shared = [LDClient get];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If your application was already taking advantage of the `startCompleteWhenFlagsReceived` method to determine when flags are received for the configured user, the static `start` method also supports the `startWaitSeconds` and `completion` parameters that follow the same behavior that `startCompleteWhenFlagReceived` had. More information on the behavior of `start` is available in the [getting started](/sdk/client-side/ios#getting-started) section of the main iOS SDK reference.

## Reconfiguring the SDK

The setter for the `LDClient.config` property was removed in the 5.0 release. You should specify your configuration up front when initializing the SDK with `start`. After the client initializes, reconfiguration is restricted to using instance methods such as `setOnline` to change the SDK state.

## Updating the active user context

The iOS SDK always operates in the context of a specific user. The SDK supports changing this user in cases that the human user logs in or out of the host application, for example.

In 4.x versions of the iOS SDK the active user could be changed by setting the `user` property of the shared `LDClient` instance. In version 4.2.0 of the SDK, this setter was deprecated in favor of the `identify(user: completion:)` method which has an optional completion indicating when flags have been received for the new user context.

In the 5.0 release, the setter for the `user` property has been removed. If your application had already migrated to `identify`, additional changes are not required as the behavior has not changed. If your application still uses the `user` property to update the active user context, you need to migrate to the `identify` method.

Here is an example of migrating to the `identify` method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="sdk4-swift"
  values={[
    { label: '4.x syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk4-swift', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk5-swift', },
    { label: '4.x syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk4-objc', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk5-objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-swift">

```swift
let newUser = LDUser(key: "user-key-123abc")
LDClient.shared.user = newUser
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-swift">

```swift
let newUser = LDUser(key: "user-key-123abc")
LDClient.get()!.identify(user: newUser)
// identify can also be called with a completion
LDClient.get()!.identify(user: newUser) {
    // Flags have been received for the new user
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-objc">

```objectivec
LDUser *newUser = [[LDUser alloc] initWithKey:@"user-key-123abc"];
[LDClient sharedInstance].user = newUser;
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-objc">

```objectivec
LDUser *newUser = [[LDUser alloc] initWithKey:@"user-key-123abc"];
[[LDClient get] identify:newUser];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

One other change to be aware of is that the optional `LDUser` initializer, `LDUser.init?(object: )`, as been removed in preference of using `LDUser.init(userDictionary: )` directly.

Read more about [changing the user context](/sdk/features/identify#ios).

## Evaluating flags

Due to a change of the parameter naming, all variation calls that specify the `fallback` parameter will need to be updated to use the `defaultValue` parameter name instead. This renaming was introduced to distinguish these application default values from the fallback values specified in the flag configuration done in the flags list.

Here is an an example using the new parameter name:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="sdk4-swift"
  values={[
    { label: '4.x syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk4-swift', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk5-swift', },
    { label: '4.x syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk4-objc', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk5-objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-swift">

```swift
let flagValue = LDClient.shared.variation(forKey: "flag-key", fallback: false)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-swift">

```swift
let flagValue = LDClient.get()!.variation(forKey: "flag-key", defaultValue: false)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-objc">

```objectivec
BOOL flagValue = [[LDClient sharedInstance] boolVariationForKey:@"flag-key" fallback:NO];
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-objc">

```objectivec
BOOL flagValue = [[LDClient get] boolVariationForKey:@"flag-key" defaultValue:NO];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If your application uses the `variationDetail` methods, and referenced the name of the return type directly, it must also be updated for the renaming of that type.

For Swift, the type has been renamed from `EvaluationDetail` to `LDEvaluationDetail` to keep with the prefixed naming convention the rest of the SDK API uses.

In the Objective-C interface the returned type is not generic, so there is a separate class for each type. In 5.0 these have Objective-C names specified to be `LD<T>EvaluationDetail` where `<T>` is the type of the flag value, rather than the Swift implementation class names which were following the pattern `ObjC<T>EvaluationDetail`. If you were using the binding classes in a Swift context they were also renamed from `ObjC<T>EvaluationDetail` to `Objc<T>EvaluationDetail` to match the capitalization of other Objective-C wrapper classes.

Here is an example using the new naming method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="sdk4-swift"
  values={[
    { label: '4.x syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk4-swift', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk5-swift', },
    { label: '4.x syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk4-objc', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk5-objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-swift">

```swift
let flagValueDetail: EvaluationDetail<Bool> = LDClient.shared.variationDetail(forKey: "flag-key", fallback: false)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-swift">

```swift
let flagValueDetail: LDEvaluationDetail<Bool> = LDClient.get()!.variationdetail(forKey: "flag-key", defaultValue: false)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-objc">

```objectivec
ObjCBoolEvaluationDetail *flagValueDetail = [[LDClient sharedInstance] boolVariationDetailForKey:@"flag-key" fallback:NO];
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-objc">

```objectivec
LDBoolEvaluationDetail *flagValueDetail = [[LDClient get] boolVariationDetailForKey:@"flag-key" defaultValue:NO];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Additionally, the deprecated `variationAndSource` methods have been removed in the 5.0 release. If your application was making use of these methods, upgrading to the 5.0 release will require migrating to the `variationDetail` methods.

Also related to flag evaluation, the `allFlagValues` method has been renamed to `allFlags` for consistency with other SDKs. If your application used `allFlagValues` the references must be changed to `allFlags`.

## Realtime updates

The SDK supports registering observers on flags to be notified when the flag value has changed. While the process for registering a receiver has not changed in the 5.0 release, the properties on the change notification value passed to your observer have changed.

For Swift, the properties `LDChangedFlag.oldValueSource` and `LDChangedFlag.newValueSource` were removed. Any `LDFlagChangeHandler`s or `LDFlagCollectionChangeHandler`s can no longer use these properties on on the provided `LDChangedFlag`(s).

The Objective-C bindings similarly no longer include the `oldValueSource` and `newValueSource` properties. Additionally, the static properties `nilSource` and `typeMismatch` of the `LDChangedFlag` Objective-C binding have been removed. As handlers can be registered for a specific flag value type, `LDChangedFlag.typeMismatch` was provided to allow using the value source to detect when a flag observer had been called for an value update with a non-matching type. In order to still allow handling this case, the `LD<T>ChangedFlag` classes now expose the boolean `typeMismatch` property that indicates whether this situation has occurred.

## Recording custom events

If your application uses `trackEvent` to record `custom` events, it is necessary to rename usages to `track`. Additionally, the type of `Error` that `track` throws when the given `data` parameter is not JSON convertible has been changed from `JSONSerialization.JSONError.invalidJsonObject` to `LDInvalidArgumentError`.

Here is an example using the new names:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="sdk4-swift"
  values={[
    { label: '4.x syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk4-swift', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk5-swift', },
    { label: '4.x syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk4-objc', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk5-objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-swift">

```swift
do {
    try LDClient.shared.trackEvent(key: "key", data: ["abc": 123])
} catch JSONSerialization.JSONError.invalidJsonObject {
    // Do something with the error
} catch {}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-swift">

```swift
do {
    try LDClient.get()!.track(key: "key", data: ["abc": 123])
} catch is LDInvalidArgumentError {
    // Do something with the error
} catch {}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-objc">

```objectivec
NSError* err = nil;
[[LDClient sharedInstance] trackEventWithKey: @"key", data: @{@"abc": @123} error: &err];
if (err != nil) {
    // Do something with the error
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-objc">

```objectivec
NSError* err = nil;
[[LDClient get] trackWithKey: @"key", data: @{@"abc": @123} error: &err];
if (err != nil) {
    // Do something with the error
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To avoid polluting classes external to the SDK, `JSONSerialization.JSONError` has been removed.

Additionally, `LDClient.reportEvents()` has been renamed to `LDClient.flush()`. If your application was using `reportEvents` to send events to LaunchDarkly immediately, this usage will need to be updated to `flush`.

## Shutting down the SDK

Under normal use it is not necessary to explicitly shut down the SDK. If your application was previously shutting down the SDK with `LDClient.stop()`, this method has been renamed to `LDClient.close()` for consistency with other SDKs.

To shut down the SDK:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="sdk4-swift"
  values={[
    { label: '4.x syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk4-swift', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Swift)', value: 'sdk5-swift', },
    { label: '4.x syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk4-objc', },
    { label: '5.0 syntax (Obj-C)', value: 'sdk5-objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-swift">

```swift
LDClient.shared.stop()
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-swift">

```swift
LDClient.get()!.close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk4-objc">

```objectivec
[[LDClient sharedInstance] stop];
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk5-objc">

```objectivec
[[LDClient get] close];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Removing exposed implementation details

The following were removed from the publicly exposed surface of the SDK. These were implementation details that were not intended to be public:

* `isEqual` extension to `Array`.
* `==` and `!=` extension to `Optional<[String: Any]>` (note that this was not declared as `Equatable` conformance).
* `Sysctl` struct.

## Highlights of new functionality

The 5.0 release also includes new features and improvements as described in the release notes.

These include:

* The SDK now has support for multiple LDClient instances that are tied to separate mobile keys, allowing the evaluation of flags in multiple environments. For more information on this feature, read [Multiple environments](/sdk/features/multiple-environments#ios).
* The SDK now periodically sends diagnostic data to LaunchDarkly, describing the version and configuration of the SDK, properties of the underlying operating system, and performance statistics. No credentials or identifiable values are included. This behavior can be disabled with `LDConfig.diagnosticOptOut(Bool)` or configured with `LDConfig.diagnosticRecordingInterval(TimeInterval)`.
* The LaunchDarkly iOS SDK is now compatible with the Swift Package Manager. Read more about building with the Swift Package Manager in the [Getting started](/sdk/client-side/ios#getting-started) section of the iOS reference guide.
* When shutting down the client instance by calling `close` (formerly `stop`), the event queue is flushed prior to shutting down. This ensures that all pending events are submitted before the client connections are closed.
* The SDK configuration now offers the ability to set a wrapper name (`LDConfig.wrapperName`) and version (`LDConfig.wrapperVersion`). These allow a library wrapping the SDK (for example, the React Native SDK) to identify itself for usage data.
