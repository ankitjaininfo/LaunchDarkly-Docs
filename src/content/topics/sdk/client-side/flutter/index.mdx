<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Version 2 of the Flutter SDK replaces users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts replace another data object in LaunchDarkly: "users."

Code samples on this page are from the two most recent SDK versions where they differ. To learn more about upgrading, read [Flutter SDK 1.x to 2.0 migration guide](/sdk/client-side/flutter/migration-1-to-2) and [Best practices for upgrading users to contexts](/guides/flags/upgrading-contexts).

## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the Flutter SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>SDK quick links</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and a sample application:

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly Flutter SDK is compatible with Android SDK versions 21 and higher and with iOS version 11.0 and higher. The LaunchDarkly Flutter SDK does not support other Flutter platforms.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting started](/home/getting-started) process, follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Flutter mobile application.

First, declare a dependency on the LaunchDarkly Flutter SDK:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="pubspec.yaml">

```yaml
  launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk: ^2.0.0
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Then, import the package in your application code:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Dart">

```dart
import 'package:launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk/launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk.dart';
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The Flutter SDK uses a mobile key</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Flutter SDK uses a mobile key. Your environment's mobile key is available in the **Projects** tab of your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects) page. To learn more about key types, read [Keys](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you install the SDK, initialize the single shared instance of `LDClient`. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key. This authorizes your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Mobile keys are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. However, never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The following example shows the simplest way to create the client:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Flutter SDK v2.0 (Dart)">

```dart
LDConfig config = LDConfigBuilder('mobile-key-123abc').build();

LDContextBuilder builder = LDContextBuilder();
builder.kind('user', 'user-key-123abc');

LDContext context = builder.build();
await LDClient.startWithContext(config, context);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Flutter SDK v1.x (Dart)">

```dart
LDConfig config = LDConfigBuilder('mobile-key-123abc').build();
LDUser user = LDUserBuilder('user-key-123abc')
    .email('sandy@example.com')
    .build();

await LDClient.start(config, user);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

This method of initializing the client lets you use the SDK as soon as it is ready to return evaluated flags.

To block until the SDK receives the most recent feature flag values, use the `LDClient.startFuture` method with `await` and an optional `timeLimit`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Flutter SDK v2.0 (Dart)">

```dart
LDConfig config = LDConfigBuilder('mobile-key-123abc').build();

LDContextBuilder builder = LDContextBuilder();
builder.kind('user', 'user-key-123abc');

LDContext context = builder.build();
await LDClient.startWithContext(config, context);
await LDClient.startFuture(timeLimit: Duration(seconds: 5));
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Flutter SDK v1.x (Dart)">

```dart
LDConfig config = LDConfigBuilder('mobile-key-123abc').build();
LDUser user = LDUserBuilder('user-key-123abc')
    .email('sandy@example.com')
    .build();

await LDClient.start(config, user);
await LDClient.startFuture(timeLimit: Duration(seconds: 5));
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you have configured the SDK not to make network requests, or if the device does not have a network connection, `LDClient.startFuture` returns a `Future` that will complete immediately to avoid blocking the application indefinitely.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to mobile SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the context will receive the fallback value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's Settings tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can use `LDClient` to check which variation a particular context will receive for a feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Dart">

```dart
bool showFeature = await LDClient.boolVariation(flagKey, false);
if (showFeature) {
    // Application code to show the feature
}
else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
