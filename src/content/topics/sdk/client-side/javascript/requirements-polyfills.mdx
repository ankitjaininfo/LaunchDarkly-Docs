## Overview

This topic explains how to add different types of polyfills in the JavaScript SDK.

Web browsers vary widely in their support of specific features and standards. It is common in JavaScript development to use [polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill) to ensure the widest possible compatibility. Polyfills are scripts that implement a feature in case it is not built into the browser.

Three features that the LaunchDarkly JavaScript SDK uses that may not be available on every browser are `Promise`, `EventSource`, and `document.querySelectorAll()`.

## Adding a polyfill

For each of these features, there are two ways you can provide the polyfill script.

The first way is to load the polyfill script directly from a CDN that hosts the package, with a `<script>` tag within the `<head>` element of your page. You must put the `<script>` tag for the polyfill _before_ any scripts that make use of the LaunchDarkly SDK.

Here is how to load a polyfill script directly from a CDN:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="HTML">

```html
<script src="[URL of the polyfill script]"></script>
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you are using a package manager such as NPM or Yarn, and using `require()` to load modules at runtime, you would first add the polyfill package to your project:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Shell">

```bash
npm install package-name-of-polyfill@package.version.number
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Then, make sure that you `require` the polyfill module prior to initializing the LaunchDarkly client:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
require('package-name-of-polyfill');
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You only need to use one of these methods. You do not need to use both a CDN and a package manager.

## Installing polyfills for specific features

Three features that the LaunchDarkly SDK uses that may not be available on every browser are `Promise`, `EventSource`, and `document.querySelectorAll()`. This section describes how to install a polyfill for each of them.

### Promise

The JavaScript SDK relies heavily on JavaScript Promises. [Browsers that do not support Promise](https://caniuse.com/#search=Promise) include Internet Explorer and older versions of Microsoft Edge. If you need to support these browsers, you will need to install a polyfill for Promise, such as [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise).

To install a polyfill for Promise:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="HTML">

```html
<!-- loading polyfill from CDN -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/es6-promise@4.2.4/dist/es6-promise.auto.min.js"></script>
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Shell">

```bash
# installing polyfill as a package
npm install es6-promise@4.2.4
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
// loading polyfill as a package
require('es6-promise/auto');
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

### EventSource

The JavaScript SDK uses [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) to provide a live streaming connection to LaunchDarkly, if you have enabled streaming.

By default, the JavaScript SDK client opens a streaming connection if you subscribe to `change` or `change:flag-key` events. You can also open a streaming connection explicitly by setting the `streaming` configuration option or using the `setStreaming` method. **If you never enable streaming, you do not need `EventSource`.** To learn more, read [Streaming](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDOptions.html#streaming).

EventSource is widely available in browsers, [except for Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge](https://caniuse.com/#search=EventSource). If you want to support these browsers, and you need streaming support, you can install a polyfill such as [event-source-polyfill](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).

To install a polyfill for EventSource:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="HTML">

```html
<!-- loading polyfill from CDN -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/event-source-polyfill@0.0.12/src/eventsource.min.js"></script>
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Shell">

```bash
# installing polyfill as a package
npm install event-source-polyfill@1.0.5
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
// loading polyfill as a package
require('event-source-polyfill');
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

### `document.querySelectorAll()`

The JavaScript SDK uses `querySelectorAll` to support `click` events for Experimentation. **If you never use click conversion metrics, you do not need `querySelectorAll`.** To learn more, read [Click conversion metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics/click).

`querySelectorAll` is widely available in browsers, [except in old versions of Internet Explorer](https://caniuse.com/#feat=queryselector). If you want to support these, and you need Experimentation support, you can install a polyfill such as [polyfill-queryselector](https://github.com/cobbdb/polyfill-queryselector).

To install a polyfill for `querySelectorAll`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="HTML">

```html
<!-- loading polyfill from CDN -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/polyfill-queryselector@1.0.2/querySelector.js"></script>
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Shell">

```bash
# installing polyfill as a package
npm install polyfill-queryselector@1.0.2
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
// loading polyfill as a package
require('polyfill-queryselector')

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
