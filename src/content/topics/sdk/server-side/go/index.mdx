<CalloutTitle>Version 6 of the Go SDK replaces users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts replace another data object in LaunchDarkly: "users."

Code samples on this page are from the two most recent SDK versions where they differ. To learn more about upgrading, read [Go SDK 5.x to 6.0 migration guide](/sdk/server-side/go/migration-5-to-6) and [Best practices for upgrading users to contexts](/guides/flags/upgrading-contexts).

<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly Go SDK, version 6.0 and higher, is compatible with Go 1.18 and higher.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Go application.

First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application. How you do this depends on what dependency management system you are using:

* If you are using the standard [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) system, import the SDK packages in your code and `go build` will automatically download them. The SDK and its dependencies are modules.
* If you are using `dep`, import the SDK packages in your code and run `dep ensure`.
* Otherwise, use the `go get` command and specify the SDK version, such as `go get github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6`.

There are several packages that you can import, depending on which features you are using. You usually need the following:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v6">

```go
import (
    // go-sdk-common/v3/ldcontext defines LaunchDarkly's model for contexts
    "github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common/v3/ldcontext"

    // go-server-sdk/v6 is the main SDK package - here we are aliasing it to "ld"
    ld "github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6"

    // go-server-sdk/v6/ldcomponents is for advanced configuration options
    "github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6/ldcomponents"
)
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v5.x">

```go
import (
    // go-sdk-common.v2/lduser defines LaunchDarkly's model for user properties
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common.v2/lduser"

    // go-server-sdk.v5 is the main SDK package - here we are aliasing it to "ld"
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5"

    // go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents is for advanced configuration options
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents"
)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

It is good practice to pin your dependencies to a specific version. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version. When you update your version of `go-server-sdk`, you should also update `go-sdk-common`.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The Go SDK uses an SDK key</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Go SDK uses an SDK key. Your environment's SDK key is available in the **Projects** tab of your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects) page. To learn more about key types, read [Keys](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of [`LDClient`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6#LDClient). Specify your SDK key here to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton for each LaunchDarkly project. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

If you have multiple LaunchDarkly projects, you can create one `LDClient` for each. In this situation, the clients operate independently. For example, they do not share a single connection to LaunchDarkly.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This example assumes you've imported the LaunchDarkly SDK package as `ld`, as shown above.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go">

```go
client, _ := ld.MakeClient("sdk-key-123abc", 5*time.Second)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The second argument to `MakeClient` is a timeout parameter. In this example, you are telling the SDK that it can spend up to five seconds attempting to connect to LaunchDarkly services before returning to your application. For more details about what the timeout means and what happens if initialization fails, read [`MakeClient`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6#MakeClient).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Best practices for error handling</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The second return type in these code samples ( `_` ) represents an error in case the LaunchDarkly client does not initialize. Consider naming the return value and using it with proper error handling.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Using the `LDClient` methods, you can check which variation a particular context should receive for a given feature flag. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating) and [Flag evaluation reasons](/sdk/features/evaluation-reasons). For more information about how contexts are specified, read [User and context configuration](/sdk/features/user-context-config).

In the v6 example, the context key is the string "context-key-123abc". In the v5 example, the user key is the string "user-key-123abc":

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v6">

```go
import (
    "github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common/v3/ldcontext"
)

flagKey := "flag-key-123abc"
context := ldcontext.NewBuilder("context-key-123abc").
    Name("Sandy").
    Build()

showFeature, _ := client.BoolVariation(flagKey, context, false)
if showFeature {
    // Application code to show the feature
} else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v5.x">

```go
import (
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common.v2/lduser"
)

flagKey := "flag-key-123abc"
user := lduser.NewUserBuilder("user-key-123abc").
    Name("Sandy").
    Build()

showFeature, _ := client.BoolVariation(flagKey, user, false)
if showFeature {
    // Application code to show the feature
} else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## HTTPS Proxy

Go's standard HTTP library provides a built-in HTTPS proxy. If the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable is present, then the SDK will proxy all network requests through the URL provided.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Console">

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="cmd">

```
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also specify a proxy programmatically through the SDK configuration:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v6">

```go
import (
    ld "github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6"
    "github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6/ldcomponents"
)

var config ld.Config
config.HTTP = ldcomponents.HTTPConfiguration().
    ProxyURL("https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080")
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v5.x">

```go
import (
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5"
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents"
)

var config ld.Config
config.HTTP = ldcomponents.HTTPConfiguration().
    ProxyURL("https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080")
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
