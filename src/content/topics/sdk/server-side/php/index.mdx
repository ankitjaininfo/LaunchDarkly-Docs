<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Version 5 of the PHP SDK replaces users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts replace another data object in LaunchDarkly: "users."

Code samples on this page are from the two most recent SDK versions where they differ. To learn more about upgrading, read [PHP SDK 4.x to 5.0 migration guide](/sdk/server-side/php/migration-4-to-5).

## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the PHP SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and a sample application:

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly PHP SDK, version 4.0 and higher, is compatible with PHP 7.3 and higher.

If you need support for older versions of PHP, use version 3.x of the LaunchDarkly PHP SDK.

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your PHP application.

The first step is to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/php-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version if you want to depend on a specific version.

To install Composer:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Shell">

```bash
php composer.phar require launchdarkly/server-sdk

# In earlier versions, this was "launchdarkly/launchdarkly-php"
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Then require Composer's autoloader:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="PHP">

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of [`LDClient`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/php-server-sdk/classes/LaunchDarkly-LDClient.html). Specify your SDK key here to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

Only create one instance of `client`.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="PHP">

```php
$client = new LaunchDarkly\LDClient("sdk-key-123abc");
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can use `$client` to check which variation a particular context will receive for a given feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="PHP">

```php
$context = LDContext::builder("context-key-123abc")
  ->name("Sandy")
  ->build();

if ($client->variation("your.flag.key", $context)) {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

In our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started) we recommend that users shut down the LaunchDarkly client on application termination. This step does not exist in PHP because the PHP SDK does not maintain long-lived network connections nor an event queue.

## Fetching flags

There are two distinct methods of integrating LaunchDarkly in a PHP environment:

- [The Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy) retrieves and stores flags in [Redis](/sdk/features/storing-data/redis), [DynamoDB](/sdk/features/storing-data/dynamodb), or [Consul](/sdk/features/storing-data/consul). This is the recommended method. If you use Big Segments, you can only use Redis or DynamoDB as a persistent store.
- [Guzzle Cache Middleware](https://github.com/Kevinrob/guzzle-cache-middleware) requests and caches HTTP responses in an in-memory array. This is the default method.

We strongly suggest using the Relay Proxy. Per-flag caching mode using Guzzle is only intended for low-throughput environments.

### Using the Relay Proxy

PHP's shared-nothing architecture prevents LaunchDarkly from reusing the streaming API connection across requests.

You can use PHP without the Relay Proxy, but we strongly recommend using the Relay Proxy in **daemon mode** if you are using PHP in a high-throughput setting. This makes the Relay Proxy receive feature flag updates.

To learn more, read [Configuring SDKs to use different modes](/home/relay-proxy/using#configuring-sdks-to-use-different-modes).

### Using Guzzle

For the latest major version of the PHP SDK, use open-ended dependencies. For older versions, refer to your version's composer.json file.

To require Guzzle as a dependency:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="PHP">

```php
php composer.phar require "guzzlehttp/guzzle:^6.3.0"
php composer.phar require "kevinrob/guzzle-cache-middleware:^1.4.0"
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Guzzle is then used to fetch flags. You can persist your cache somewhere other than the default in-memory store, like Memcached or Redis.

You can then specify your cache when initializing the client with the cache option:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="PHP">

```php
$client = new LaunchDarkly\LDClient("sdk-key-123abc", array("cache" => $cacheStorage));
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
