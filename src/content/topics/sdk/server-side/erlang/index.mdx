<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Version 2 of the Erlang SDK replaces users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product.

You can upgrade your SDK at any time. However, the ability to target by context, or review context instances that have encountered flags in your application, is only available for customers in the contexts Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access this feature, [join the EAP](https://launchdarkly.com/eap). If you are not part of the EAP, your application can send user contexts to LaunchDarkly and they will appear on the **Users** list.

Code samples on this page are from the two most recent SDK versions where they differ. To learn more about upgrading, read [Erlang SDK 1.x to 2.0 migration guide](/sdk/server-side/erlang/migration-1-to-2).

## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the Erlang SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

<Callout intent="primary">

<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and sample applications:

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to get started using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Erlang application.

First, download the dependency using [Rebar](https://www.rebar3.org/):

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Erlang">

```erlang
{deps, [
  {ldclient, "2.0.0", {pkg, launchdarkly_server_sdk}}
]}.
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Then, add it to your `app.src` file:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Erlang">

```erlang
{applications,
  [kernel,
  stdlib,
  ldclient
]},
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you use Elixir, you can download the dependency using [Mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html):

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Elixir">

```erlang
defp deps do
  [
    {:ldclient, "~> 2.0.0", hex: :launchdarkly_server_sdk}
  ]
end
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

After you install the SDK dependency, create an instance of the SDK.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Use a single instance</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Erlang SDK supports starting multiple instances, but most use cases only need a single instance. Consider using multiple instances only if you need to simultaneously access more than one environment. Do not start an instance every time you need to make a variation or other SDK call.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Erlang">

```erlang
% This starts an instance with the default options
ldclient:start_instance("sdk-key-123abc")

% You can also start a named instance
ldclient:start_instance("sdk-key-123abc", your_instance)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Next, check which flag variation a specific context should receive:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Erlang SDK v2.0">

```erlang
Flag = ldclient:variation(<<"flag-key-123abc">>, #{key => <<"context-key-123abc">>}, false)
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Erlang SDK v1.x">

```erlang
Flag = ldclient:variation(<<"flag-key-123abc">>, #{key => <<"user-key-123abc">>}, false)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>


## Transport Layer Security (TLS)

The SDK includes configuration options that allow you to set custom TLS options. If you don't set these options, then the SDK will use the Erlang/OTP defaults. The default TLS connection settings in Erlang/OTP do not validate the identity or authenticity of certificates.

If your application has existing TLS options, then you can pass them to the SDK:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Erlang">

```erlang
  ldclient:start_instance(SdkKey, #{
  http_options => #{
      tls_options => YourOptions
  }}),
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The SDK also provides helper methods to create TLS options. We recommend ensuring that the SDK is using a Certificate Authorities (CA) store that is regularly updated for production environments.

Here is a list of helper methods:

- `ldclient_config:tls_basic_options()`: This helper provides a basic TLS configuration suitable for development. It tries to use a CA store in the default location for many linux distributions (`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`). If it can't find the store, then it will use the store from the `certifi` package.
- `ldclient_config:tls_basic_linux_options()`: This helper provides a basic TLS configuration for linux. It uses the CA store located at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.
- `ldclient_config:tls_ca_certfile_options(CaStorePath)`: This helper provides a basic TLS configuration with the CA store you specify.
- `ldclient_config:tls_basic_certifi_options()`: This helper provides a basic TLS configuration that uses the `certifi` store. Because this store is from a dependency of the package, it is not maintained or updated by OS releases.
- `ldclient_config:with_tls_revocation(TlsOptions)`: This helper extends a TLS configuration with certificate revocation. Revocation is not included in the basic configuration because the Erlang/OTP does not cache revocation results. Enabling this feature incurs additional requests per request the SDK makes.

## Shutting down

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#erlang).
