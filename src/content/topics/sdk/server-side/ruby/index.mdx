<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Version 7 of the Ruby SDK replaces users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts replace another data object in LaunchDarkly: "users."

Code samples on this page are from the two most recent SDK versions where they differ. To learn more about upgrading, read [Ruby SDK 6.x to 7.0 migration guide](/sdk/server-side/ruby/migration-6-to-7).

## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the server-side Ruby SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>RubyGems bug</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Due to a bug in recent versions of RubyGems, RubyGems versions 2.4.x are not compatible with the LaunchDarkly Ruby SDK.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly Ruby SDK, version 7.0 and higher, is compatible with Ruby 2.7 and higher.

Prior to version 7.0, the LaunchDarkly Ruby SDK also supported Ruby 2.5 and 2.6.

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Ruby application.

First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application using your application's dependency manager. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version if you want to depend on a specific version.

If you are using Bundler, you can add `gem "launchdarkly-server-sdk"` to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`. Otherwise, you can install the gem directly:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Shell">

```bash
gem install launchdarkly-server-sdk
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Next, import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code. This step may not be necessary if you are using a framework that automatically loads all dependencies, as Rails does.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Ruby">

```ruby
require 'ldclient-rb'
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`. Specify your SDK key here to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Ruby">

```ruby
client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new("sdk-key-123abc")
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton for each LaunchDarkly project. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

If you have multiple LaunchDarkly projects, you can create one `LDClient` for each. In this situation, the clients operate independently. For example, they do not share a single connection to LaunchDarkly.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can use `client` to check which variation a particular context will receive for a given feature flag. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating) and [Flag evaluation reasons](/sdk/features/evaluation-reasons). For more information about how contexts are specified, read [User and context configuration](/sdk/features/user-context-config).

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Ruby SDK v7.0">

```ruby
context = LaunchDarkly::LDContext.with_key("user@test.com")
show_feature = client.variation("your.flag.key", context, false)
if show_feature
  # application code to show the feature
else
  # the code to run if the feature is off
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Ruby SDK v6.x">

```ruby
show_feature = client.variation("your.flag.key", {key: "user@test.com"}, false)
if show_feature
  # application code to show the feature
else
  # the code to run if the feature is off
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Initializing LDClient in a Rails Application

To use LaunchDarkly in a Rails application, initialize the client in `config/initializers/launchdarkly.rb`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Ruby">

```ruby
Rails.configuration.client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new("sdk-key-123abc")
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To use LaunchDarkly with the Rails application preloader [Spring](https://github.com/rails/spring), we recommend using an `after_fork` callback in the config/spring.rb file:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Ruby Spring initialization">

```ruby
Spring.after_fork do
  Rails.configuration.client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new('SDK KEY')
end
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Similarly, with [Unicorn](https://bogomips.org/unicorn/), you'll need to specify an `after_fork` hook in your unicorn.rb config file:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Ruby Unicorn initialization">

```ruby
after_fork do |server,worker|
  Rails.configuration.client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new('SDK KEY')
end
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you use the [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) web server, we recommend initializing the client in `on_worker_boot`, as well as initializing in the Rails app:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Ruby Puma initialization">

```ruby
on_worker_boot do
  Rails.configuration.client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new('SDK KEY')
end
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If you use the [Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/indepth/ruby/spawn_methods/#smart-spawning-hooks) web server, we recommend initializing the client in `config.ru`, or from any code called while loading `config.ru`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Ruby">

```ruby
if defined?(PhusionPassenger)
  PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
    Rails.configuration.client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new('SDK KEY')
  end
end
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. This frees the resources the worker threads were using and provides an explicit signal for the Ruby SDK to send the remaining event data back to LaunchDarkly. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#ruby).
