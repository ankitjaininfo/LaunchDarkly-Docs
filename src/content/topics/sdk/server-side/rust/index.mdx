<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Version 1 of the Rust SDK replaces users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts replace another data object in LaunchDarkly: "users."

Code samples on this page are from version 1 of the Rust SDK. To learn more about implementing version 1 if you have been using the beta version, read [Rust SDK v1 implementation guide](/sdk/server-side/rust/implementation-v1) and [Best practices for upgrading users to contexts](/guides/flags/upgrading-contexts).

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and a sample application:

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Rust application.

First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Shell">

```bash
cargo add launchdarkly-server-sdk
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Next, import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Rust">

```rust
use launchdarkly_server_sdk::{Client, ConfigBuilder, ContextBuilder, ServiceEndpointsBuilder};
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of the LaunchDarkly client. Specify your SDK key here so that your application is authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly, your application, and your environment.

Once you have created the client, start the client process and wait for the client to initialize. This SDK depends on the tokio crate to provide a default runtime and as such it is a required dependency.

Only create one instance of `client`.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Rust">

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main () {
    let config = ConfigBuilder::new(&sdk_key).build();
    let client = Client::build(config).unwrap();

    client.start_with_default_executor();

    if !client.initialized_async().await {
        panic!("Client failed to successfully initialize");
    }
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>client must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `client` a singleton for each LaunchDarkly project. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

If you have multiple LaunchDarkly projects, you can create one `LDClient` for each. In this situation, the clients operate independently. For example, they do not share a single connection to LaunchDarkly.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can use `client` to check which variation a particular context will receive for a given feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Rust">

```rust
let context = ContextBuilder::new("specific.context.key").build();
let show_feature = client.bool_variation(&context, "your.flag.key", false);

if show_feature {
  # application code to show the feature
} else {
  # the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
