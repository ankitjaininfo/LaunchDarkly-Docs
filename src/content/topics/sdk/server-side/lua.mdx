## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the Lua SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features. We also provide documentation for running the SDK in [NGINX](/guides/sdk/nginx) and [HAProxy](/guides/sdk/haproxy).

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>SDK quick links</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and sample applications:

## Getting started

After you complete the  [Getting Started](/home/getting-started) process, follow these steps to get started using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Lua application.

The Lua server-side SDK is implemented using a foreign function interface that calls the C/C++ server-side SDK. You need to install the C/C++ server-side SDK dynamic library somewhere accessible by the linker.

To learn more, read [C/C++ SDK reference (server-side)](/sdk/server-side/c-c--).

First, include the library:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Lua">

```lua
local ld = require("launchdarkly_server_sdk")
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The Lua SDK uses an SDK key</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Lua SDK uses an SDK key. Your environment's SDK key is available in the **Projects** tab of your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects) page. To learn more about key types, read [Keys](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`. Specify your SDK key here to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton for each LaunchDarkly project. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

If you have multiple LaunchDarkly projects, you can create one `LDClient` for each. In this situation, the clients operate independently. For example, they do not share a single connection to LaunchDarkly.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Calling `clientInit` initiates a remote call to the LaunchDarkly service to fetch feature flags. This call blocks up to the time defined by `maxwaitmilliseconds`. If you request a feature flag before the client completes initialization, you will receive the default flag value.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Lua">

```lua
local config = {
    key = sdk-key-123abc
}

local client = ld.clientInit(config, 1000)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can use `client` to check which variation a particular user will receive for a given feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Lua">

```lua
if client:boolVariation(user, flag-key-123abc, false) then
    print "feature is enabled"
else
    print "feature is disabled"
end
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
