<CalloutTitle>Version 4 of the Haskell SDK replaces users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product.

Code samples on this page are from the two most recent SDK versions where they differ. To learn more about upgrading, read [Haskell SDK 3.x to 3.0 migration guide](/sdk/server-side/haskell/migration-3-to-4).

## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the Haskell SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>SDK quick links</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and a sample application:

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to get started using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Haskell application.

The root module of the SDK `LaunchDarkly.Server` re-exports the entire project.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Haskell">

```haskell
import LaunchDarkly.Server
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The Haskell SDK uses an SDK key</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Haskell SDK uses an SDK key. Your environment's SDK key is available in the **Projects** tab of your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects) page. To learn more about key types, read [Keys](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you import and install the SDK, create a single shared instance of `Client`. Specify your SDK key to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Haskell">

```haskell
client :: IO Client
client = makeClient $ makeConfig "sdk-key-123abc"
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Client must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `Client` a singleton for each LaunchDarkly project. The client instance maintains an internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

If you have multiple LaunchDarkly projects, you can create one `LDClient` for each. In this situation, the clients operate independently. For example, they do not share a single connection to LaunchDarkly.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can use `client` to check which variation a particular context will receive for a given feature flag. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating) and [Flag evaluation reasons](/sdk/features/evaluation-reasons). For more information about how contexts are specified, read [User and context configuration](/sdk/features/user-context-config).

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Haskell SDK v4.0">

```haskell
boolVariation client "flag-key-123abc" (makeContext "context-key-123abc" "context-kind") False
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Haskell SDK v3.x">

```haskell
boolVariation client "flag-key-123abc" (makeUser "user-key-123abc") False
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Shutting down

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#haskell).
