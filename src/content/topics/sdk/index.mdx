<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Custom contexts are now available for Early Access Program customers</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The custom contexts Early Access Program (EAP) is now available. To learn more about the fundamentals of contexts and how they work in LaunchDarkly, read [Contexts and segments](/home/contexts).

Below is a list of SDKs we support as part of the custom contexts EAP. We are adding new supported SDKs to the EAP regularly. When an SDK's updated documentation is available, a link to those docs will appear in the list.

The following server-side SDK versions support contexts:

<ul>
 <li><a href="/sdk/server-side/dotnet/migration-6-to-7">.NET (server-side) SDK 7.0.0</a></li>
 <li><a href="/sdk/server-side/go/migration-5-to-6">Go SDK 6.0.0</a></li>
 <li><a href="/sdk/server-side/haskell/migration-3-to-4">Haskell SDK 4.0.0</a></li>
 <li><a href="/sdk/server-side/java/migration-5-to-6">Java SDK 6.0.0</a></li>
 <li><a href="/sdk/server-side/node-js/migration-6-to-7">Node.js (server-side) SDK 7.0.0</a></li>
 <li><a href="/sdk/server-side/php/migration-4-to-5">PHP SDK 5.0.0</a></li>
 <li><a href="/sdk/server-side/python/migration-7-to-8">Python SDK 8.0.0</a></li>

 <li><a href="/sdk/server-side/rust/implementation-v1">Rust SDK 1.0.0</a></li>
</ul>

The following client-side SDK versions support contexts:

<ul>
 <li><a href="/sdk/client-side/dotnet/migration-2-to-3">.NET (client-side) SDK 3.0.0</a></li>
 <li><a href="/sdk/client-side/android/migration-3-to-4">Android SDK 4.0.0</a></li>
 <li>iOS SDK 8.0.0 (<a href="/sdk/client-side/ios/migration-7-to-8-swift">Swift</a> and <a href="/sdk/client-side/ios/migration-7-to-8-objc">Objective-C</a>)</li>
 <li><a href="/sdk/client-side/javascript/migration-2-to-3">JavaScript SDK 3.0.0</a></li>
 <li><a href="/sdk/client-side/node-js/migration-2-to-3">Node.js (client-side) SDK 3.0.0</a></li>

## Overview

This topic explains the prerequisites you must consider when you're setting up a LaunchDarkly SDK for the first time.

## Getting started with LaunchDarkly SDKs

The SDK types have different security considerations, as well as behavioral and architectural differences. They handle flag evaluations differently, utilize different kinds of SDK keys, and support different languages. Consider your use case carefully before you decide which SDKs to use.

To learn more, read [Getting started with SDKs](/sdk/concepts/getting-started).

The SDKs are designed to evaluate feature flags in your application. If you want to interact programmatically with the LaunchDarkly product, for example to create or update account members, projects, or environments, or to search for existing flags, you'll need to use the [LaunchDarkly API](/home/connecting/api). To learn more about the differences between these offerings, read [Comparing LaunchDarkly's REST API and SDK](/guide/api/comparing-sdk-rest-api).

## Available SDKs

If you already know which SDKs you want to use, choose from the list of supported SDKs below.

If the language or framework you use is not listed here, we may provide a [sample application](/sdk/concepts/sample-applications) to help you get started. Sample applications demonstrate that an SDK is compatible with a particular language or framework. However, LaunchDarkly only provides full support for those languages or frameworks that have a dedicated SDK.

We provide the following SDKs:
