<CalloutTitle>Version 2 of the Cloudflare SDK replaces users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts replace another data object in LaunchDarkly: "users."

Code samples on this page are from the two most recent SDK versions where they differ. To learn more about upgrading, read [Cloudflare 1.x to 2.0 migration guide](/sdk/server-side/cloudflare/migration-1-to-2) and [Best practices for upgrading users to contexts](/guides/flags/upgrading-contexts).

  <CalloutTitle>This SDK requires LaunchDarkly's Cloudflare integration</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

Configure the Cloudflare integration to use this SDK successfully. To learn more, read [Cloudflare](/integrations/cloudflare).

The Cloudflare integration is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>For use in Cloudflare Workers only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended only for use in multi-user Cloudflare Workers. Choose one of the other JavaScript-based SDKs for browser, server, or mobile environments.

<br/>

Client-side browser environments:
- For React applications, read the [React SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/react).
- For Vue applications, read the [Vue SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/vue).
- For all other client-side browser JavaScript applications, read the [JavaScript SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/javascript).

Non-browser environments:

- For server-side Node applications, read the [Node.js SDK reference (server-side)](/sdk/server-side/node-js).
- For client-side Node applications, read the [Node.js SDK reference (client-side)](/sdk/client-side/node-js).
- For React Native mobile applications read the [React Native SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/react/react-native).
- For Electron desktop applications, read the [Electron SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/electron).

To learn more about LaunchDarkly's different SDK types, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

</CalloutDescription>

## Daemon mode

The Cloudflare SDK operates in daemon mode using the Cloudflare KV as a persistent feature store without connecting to LaunchDarkly. The Cloudflare SDK does not support streaming and does not send any analytics events to LaunchDarkly.

To learn more, read [Persistent data stores](/sdk/concepts/data-stores#using-a-persistent-feature-store-without-connecting-to-launchdarkly).

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Cloudflare Worker.

First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application using your application's dependency manager.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @launchdarkly/cloudflare-server-sdk
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="npm">

```bash
npm i @launchdarkly/cloudflare-server-sdk
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Then turn on the Node.js compatibility flag in your `wrangler.toml`. This allows the SDK to use `node:events`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="wrangler.toml">

```shell
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Next, import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="TypeScript/JavaScript ES6">

```ts
import { init } from '@launchdarkly/cloudflare-server-sdk';
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript CJS">

```js
const { init } = require('@launchdarkly/cloudflare-server-sdk');
```

</CSTab>

</CodeSample>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The Cloudflare SDK uses a client-side ID</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Cloudflare SDK uses a client-side ID to associate the LaunchDarkly environment with the CDN integration. Your environment's client-side ID is available in the **Projects** tab of your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects) page. To learn more about key types, read [Keys](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you install and import the SDK, create an instance of `LDClient`. Specify your client-side ID and Cloudflare KV namespace here. The client-side ID is only used to query the KV namespace, not to connect with LaunchDarkly servers.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```js
const client = init(sdkKey, env.LD_KV);
await client.waitForInitialization();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Await the `waitForInitialization` function after you initialize the client. When `waitForInitialization` is resolved the client can serve feature flags.

Using `client`, you can check which variation a particular context will receive for a given feature flag. In your Cloudflare Worker application, place the `client.variation` code so that it is invoked as needed.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const context = {
   "kind": 'user',
   "key": 'user-key-123abc',
   "name": 'Sandy'
};

const flagValue = await client.variation('flag-key-123abc', context, false);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Example Worker

This is an example Cloudflare Worker application that initializes the ldClient and evaluates a feature flag for a context.
<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```ts
import { init } from '@launchdarkly/cloudflare-server-sdk';

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Bindings): Promise<Response> {
    const context = { kind: 'user', key: 'test-user-key-1' };

    // init the ldClient, wait and finally evaluate
    const client = init('sdk-key', env.LD_KV);
    await client.waitForInitialization();
    const flagValue = await client.variation('flag-key', context, false);

    return new Response(`${flagValue}`);
  },
};
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Read the full example in [GitHub](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-core/tree/main/packages/sdk/cloudflare/example).

## Promises and async

All asynchronous SDK methods that return a `Promise` are compatible with `then/catch` or `async/await`. You can use either.

## Shutting down

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#cloudflare).
