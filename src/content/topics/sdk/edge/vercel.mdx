## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the Vercel SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and a sample application:

  <CalloutTitle>This SDK requires LaunchDarkly's Vercel integration</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

Configure the Vercel integration to use this SDK successfully. To learn more, read [Vercel](/integrations/vercel).

The Vercel integration is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

## Getting started

To install and configure the Vercel SDK in an existing project:

After you complete the [Creating a Vercel integration](/integrations/vercel#installing-a-vercel-integration) process, follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly Vercel SDK.

First, install the Vercel SDK as a dependency in your application using your application's dependency manager.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @launchdarkly/vercel-server-sdk
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="npm">

```bash
npm i @launchdarkly/vercel-server-sdk
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Next, import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="TypeScript/JavaScript ES6">

```ts
import { init } from '@launchdarkly/vercel-server-sdk'
import { createClient } from '@vercel/edge-config'
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="JavaScript CJS">

```js
const { init } = require('@launchdarkly/vercel-server-sdk')
const { createClient } = require('@vercel/edge-config')
```

</CSTab>

</CodeSample>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The Vercel SDK uses a client-side ID</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Vercel SDK uses a client-side ID. Your environment's client-side ID is available in the **Projects** tab of your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects) page. To learn more about key types, read [Keys](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you install and import the SDK, create an edge client using your [Edge Config ID](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config). Then, initialize an `LDClient` using your LaunchDarkly client-side ID and this edge client.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```js
const edgeClient = createClient(process.env.EDGE_CONFIG)
const ldClient = init('<client-side-id-123abc>', edgeClient)

await ldClient.waitForInitialization()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

After you initialize the client, wait for the `waitForInitialization` function to resolve. When `waitForInitialization` is resolved, the client can serve feature flags.

Using the client, you can check which variation a particular context will receive for a given feature flag. In your Vercel Edge application, place the `client.variation` code so that it is invoked as needed.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const ldContext = {
  kind: 'org',
  key: 'org-key-123abc',
  someAttribute: 'example-attribute-value',
}
const flagValue = await ldClient.variation('flag-key-123abc', ldContext, true)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Bootstrapping flags with Next.js

If you are using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with Vercel, you can bootstrap feature flags on the [Root Layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required) for use in the LaunchDarkly React SDK. To bootstrap flags, specify the root layout's runtime with a value of `edge` and pass the flags to a [client component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#client-components) that initializes the LaunchDarkly React SDK.

The Vercel SDK's GitHub repository contains an [example application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-core/blob/main/packages/sdk/vercel/examples/complete/README.md) that takes advantage of bootstrapping flags from the edge for use in the LaunchDarkly React SDK.

## Promises and async

All asynchronous SDK methods that return a `Promise` are compatible with `then/catch` or `async/await`. You can use either.

## Shutting down

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#vercel).

## Supported features

This SDK supports the following features:

- [Anonymous contexts and users](/sdk/features/anonymous#vercel)
