## Overview

This topic explains how to set up notifications to learn about version updates and end of life notices for LaunchDarkly's SDKs. You have several options for receiving notifications about new versions of LaunchDarkly's SDKs. You can also subscribe to notifications about SDK versions that are approaching their end of life.

## Using GitHub for notifications

All of the LaunchDarkly SDKs have [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-sdk+org%3Alaunchdarkly&type=Repositories). You can use some of GitHub's features to stay informed about new versions of LaunchDarkly's SDKs.

### Watching a repository

For the particular SDK you are interested in, you can "watch" the repository to receive updates when new versions are released. To learn more, read the GitHub documentation on [Configuring your watch settings for an individual repository](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository).

### Subscribing to a release RSS feed

For the particular SDK you are interested in, you can subscribe to the RSS feed for the GitHub releases.

The location of the RSS feed is:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="RSS feed">

```bash
# general format
https://github.com/:organization/:repo/releases.atom

# example
https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client-sdk/releases.atom
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If your team uses Slack as a collaboration tool, you can also subscribe a Slack channel to the release RSS feed. In your Slack channel, type `/feed subscribe <RSS feed>` to subscribe.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Slack channel subscription">

```bash
# general format
/feed subscribe https://github.com/:organization/:repo/releases.atom

# example
/feed subscribe https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client-sdk/releases.atom
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Getting notifications in the LaunchDarkly web application

Within the LaunchDarkly application, you'll automatically receive notifications when SDK versions are nearing end of life (one month prior) and again when they are past end of life. The notifications are based on SDK usage within each LaunchDarkly environment. To learn more, read the full list of [LaunchDarkly's supported SDK versions](/sdk/concepts/versioning#supported-versions).

## Using package managers for notifications

The LaunchDarkly SDKs are published through language-specific package managers. For the particular SDK you are interested in, you can subscribe to notifications or to an RSS feed directly through the package manager's site to receive updates when new versions are released if the package manager supports such a feature. For example, the [Ruby SDK](/sdk/server-side/ruby) is published through [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/launchdarkly-server-sdk/) which exposes an RSS feed.

## Updating to a new SDK version

When you are ready to update, check the SDK reference page for your [client-side](/sdk/client-side) or [server-side](/sdk/server-side) SDK, then navigate to the migration guide. Alternatively, use the search bar to search for "migration guide."

In many cases, we provide a migration guide from the previous major version.
