## Overview

This topic explains what LaunchDarkly's built-in attributes are and how to configure them.

LaunchDarkly allows you to target contexts based on built-in attributes. To learn more, read [Targeting rules](/home/flags/targeting-rules).

## Using built-in attributes

The built-in attributes are kind, key, name, and anonymous. Kind, key, and name attributes must be strings, and anonymous attributes must be booleans. You can define additional attributes for a context by passing in a name and value for each.

The context kind and key are the only mandatory attributes. All other attributes are optional. Some SDKs will automatically set the kind to "user" if you do not provide a value.

<CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly does not automatically populate built-in attributes</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

While LaunchDarkly provides built-in attribute fields for you to fill in, the SDK does not automatically collect any information. If you want to target contexts based on any built-in attributes, you must supply their values for each variation call. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating).

Here is a table explaining LaunchDarkly's built-in attributes:

<Table>

    <TableHeadCell>Attribute example value</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Notes</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>kind</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"user"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The context kind. Required for evaluation.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>key</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"context-key-123abc"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Required for evaluation. This should be unique for each context.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>name</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"Sandy Smith"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>This attribute is optional, but we recommend including it if you need to target flags to individual contexts.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>anonymous</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>true</TableCell>
      <TableCell>If set, this boolean attribute prevents the context from appearing in the <strong>Contexts</strong> list. If the anonymous attribute is set to <code>true</code>, LaunchDarkly treats the context as anonymous.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

<CalloutTitle>Creating searchable context keys</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can structure your context keys so they are both searchable and unique. To do this, we suggest adding a searchable term to the beginning of the key, followed by a unique ID. For example, if you wanted to easily search users that encountered a specific service, you could structure the key as follows: `service_name:uuid`.

Alternatively, you can set unique identifiers for contexts in your SDK configuration. To learn more, read [Application metadata configuration](/sdk/features/app-config).

You can view a context's attributes by clicking on the individual context from the [**Contexts** list](https://app.launchdarkly.com/contexts).
