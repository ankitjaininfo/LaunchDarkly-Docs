## Overview

This topic explains what the context details page is. The context details page gives you a detailed view of a context and lets you customize its experience from one screen.

To open the details page for a context, click on the context name from the **Contexts** list.

This is an example of a multi-context details page:

![The details page for a multi-context.](context-details-multi-context.png)

## Attributes

The "Attributes" section displays all of the context attributes associated with the selected context instance version. A context instance version is a context instance that's recorded from a unique source application or LaunchDarkly SDK. To learn more, read [Understanding context instances](/home/contexts#understanding-context-instances).

This illustration shows a flag evaluating two instance versions of the same context:

![Two instance versions of the same context.](context-instance-versions.png)

To view attributes from a different context instance version, choose a different version from the "From source" menu:

To learn more, read [Context attributes](/home/contexts/attributes).

You can also use the REST API: [Get context attribute names](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Contexts-(beta)#operation/getContextAttributeNames), [Get context attribute values](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Contexts-(beta)#operation/getContextAttributeValues)

## Segments

The "Segments" section lists any segments the context is a part of. Click on the segment name to open the segment's **Targeting** tab.

To learn more, read [Segments](/home/contexts/segments).

## Instances

The "Instances" section lists the instances in which the context has appeared, and when LaunchDarkly last encountered each instance:

Click on an individual instance name to open the instance details page. The instance details page lists the context kinds, attributes, segments, and expected flag variations for that particular context instance.

### Deleting a context instance

You can delete a context instance by clicking on an individual instance name to open the instance details page, then clicking **Delete**:

Deleting a context instance deletes all versions of that instance. Deleting context instances from the **Contexts** list does not decrease your monthly active users (MAU) count.

## Expected flag variations

The "Expected flag variations" section lists the variation you can expect that context instance to receive for each flag within your current project and environment.

### Modifying feature flag variations for a context

You can modify the feature flag variation a context receives. To do this:

1. Find the flag you want to modify in the "Expected flag variations" section.
2. Select a new variation from the **Variation** menu next to the flag:

3. (Optional) To remove individual targeting, either:
  - change to the variation from the **Variation** dropdown, or
  - click the "Evaluation reason" link to remove the individual target from the flag's **Targeting** tab.
4. Click **Save changes**.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Flag targeting changes are only available for individual contexts.</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You cannot make targeting changes to context instances with multiple contexts. That option is not available on the instance details page with multiple contexts.
