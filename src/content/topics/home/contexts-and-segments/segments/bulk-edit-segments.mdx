## Overview

If you have a long list of contexts you want to add, remove, or replace within a segment, you can bulk edit contexts from a segment's **Targeting** tab.

To edit contexts in bulk:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** list and choose the segment you wish to modify.
2. In the "Included targets" or "Excluded targets" section, click the **overflow menu**.
3. Select "Bulk edit." A "Bulk editing targets" dialog appears.
4. Use the menu to do one of the following actions:
  - "Add" adds the selected contexts as targets
  - "Remove" removes the selected contexts as targets
  - "Replace" replaces all currently targeted contexts with the selected contexts
5. Enter a list of context keys or email addresses in the **these targets** field, separated by a comma or new line. LaunchDarkly looks up contexts by key or email and displays them in the list on the right. If you want to target a context that has not yet been encountered by LaunchDarkly, you must enter their key.

You can update the list on the right before you perform the selected action. The options for updating the list include the following:

- **All** represents all of the contexts that may be impacted by the action, whether they are added or removed. Check the context's checkbox for the action to apply.
- **The checkmark** represents inputted context keys that currently match contexts in the system. For example, if you enter the context key `context-key-123abc`, and `context-key-123abc` already exists in LaunchDarkly, it will show up in this list.
- **The question mark** represents contexts with no matching records in LaunchDarkly. If you are adding contexts and the contexts do not currently exist in LaunchDarkly, they will be added to the targeting list.
- **The exclamation mark** represents context key inputs with multiple matching records. For example, if you enter the email address `sandy@example.com`, but there are multiple context keys that have `sandy@example.com` as an email address, the system may return multiple matching records. You can select the correct record by clicking the checkbox.
- **Current** lists all of the currently targeted contexts for the segment.

6. Click **Add N targets**, **Remove N targets**, or **Replace N targets** to perform the selected action.
