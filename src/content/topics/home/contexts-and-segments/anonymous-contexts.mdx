## Overview

This topic explains what anonymous contexts are, how their information is handled in LaunchDarkly, and how they contribute to your monthly active users (MAU) count.

You can designate any context as an anonymous context. Anonymous contexts work just like other contexts, except that they don't appear on your **Contexts** list in LaunchDarkly. You can't search for anonymous contexts on your **Contexts** list, and you can't search or autocomplete by anonymous context keys. Anonymous contexts still count toward your client-side MAU limit.

Designating anonymous contexts prevents unauthenticated users from diluting useful data on user contexts in the **Contexts** list. You can set the key attribute to a unique value for each context, or you can have your client-side SDK generate a unique, random value for each anonymous context and set the key attribute for you.

You can use anonymous contexts to hide personally identifiable information (PII), but we recommend using private attributes instead. To learn more, read [Using private context attributes](/home/contexts/attributes#using-private-context-attributes).

</CalloutDescription>

To learn how to create anonymous contexts, read your SDK-specific section in [Anonymous contexts and users](/sdk/features/anonymous).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Consider using multi-contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

On a sign-in page in a single-page app, you could represent the same person as an anonymous user before they log in, and a different user after they log in. You can initialize the client with an anonymous context with a context kind of "user." After the person logs in, you can update the user context so that it's no longer anonymous.

Alternatively, you could use a multi-context, that is, a set of several different contexts that you want to evaluate together. For example, as soon as an end user visits your app, you may initialize the client with a context using a context kind of "device." When the end user logs in, you now also have their user information. To learn more, read [Associating anonymous contexts with logged-in end users](#associating-anonymous-contexts-with-logged-in-end-users).

## Understanding context account limits

Your account is limited to 100,000,000 contexts by default. You may hit this limit accidentally if you use too many unique keys. If you feel like you hit this limit too frequently, you may be creating more contexts than you realize, including anonymous contexts.

Here are some examples of ways you may unintentionally create unique context keys:

* By creating contexts that include request IDs. When you do this, each context generates a new context key every time it requests against the server. Contexts do not need a unique key to use a request ID. For example, an unauthenticated API might only give you a request ID, not a context key.
* By creating contexts from server-to-server communication where there are no human operators, just software components interacting.
* By using LaunchDarkly to configure log levels or tracing. When you do this, you may use a different type of ID, like a timestamp. LaunchDarkly classifies each of those IDs as unique IDs.

To learn how to delete a context instance, read [Removing a context instance](/home/contexts/contexts-list#removing-a-context-instance).

## Managing anonymous contexts and MAU

LaunchDarkly identifies all contexts by their unique key, including anonymous contexts. Using unique keys for anonymous contexts allows you to observe anonymous traffic interacting with your application, target anonymous traffic with percentage rollouts, and use Experimentation.

Anonymous contexts can raise your MAU count, but there are actions you can take to manage your MAU when using anonymous contexts. To learn more about MAU, read [Account usage metrics](/home/billing/usage-metrics).

### Storing anonymous keys locally

If you provide the anonymous context key yourself, you must ensure that the context uses that same key on each subsequent visit to avoid inflating your MAU.

One strategy to make sure that you're using the same anonymous context key each time is to store the unique identifier in a cookie or local storage. Because this is such a common strategy, we've implemented it directly into our client-side SDKs. If you use a client-side SDK and want to use a unique key for your anonymous contexts, you can defer key generation onto the SDK. To do this, build a context object and omit the key completely. The SDK generates a unique identifier for the context and persists this unique identifier in local storage. Each subsequent context evaluation without a context key uses that saved unique identifier. To learn more, read [Anonymous contexts and users](/sdk/features/anonymous).

A challenge from using cookies or local storage is that they are optional. End users can turn them off. They are also often not observed by bots and site crawlers.

### Waiting to initialize your SDK

If you don't need to expose flags to anonymous contexts, don't initialize the SDK client for anonymous contexts. Instead, wait to initialize the client until after you know who your audience is. To learn more about SDK client initialization, read the [Getting started documentation for your SDK](/sdk).

### Using a shared key between anonymous contexts

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Using a shared key prevents the use of some LaunchDarkly features</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It is possible to use one, shared key between anonymous contexts. However, we do not recommend this. Using a shared key between anonymous contexts means that percentage rollouts, Experimentation, individual targeting, and other features will be limited or will not work as expected.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Details summary="Click to expand details on using a shared key">


To use a shared context key, set the key attribute to the same value for each of your anonymous contexts. Because the context key is the same, all anonymous single contexts will count as a single context instance toward your client-side MAU limit. Anonymous multi-contexts may count as more than one MAU.

However, using a shared key means that some LaunchDarkly features will not work as expected. 

These features are affected when you use a shared key between anonymous contexts:
- **Individual targeting:** You cannot individually target anonymous contexts if they share the same key. To learn more, read [Individual targeting](/home/flags/individual-targeting).
- **Percentage rollouts:** If you are targeting anonymous contexts in percentage rollouts, you must assign variations by a unique attribute other than the key. Otherwise, all anonymous contexts will be served the same variation, and the feature may be rolled out to a much larger percentage of contexts than you intend. To learn more about variation assignments by attribute, read [Understanding percentage rollout logic](/home/flags/rollouts#understanding-percentage-rollout-logic).
- **Experimentation:** If you target anonymous contexts with a shared key within an experiment, a disproportionately large number of contexts will receive the same variation and your experiment results will be unreliable. To learn more about audience allocation for an experiment, read [Allocating experiment audiences](/home/creating-experiments/allocation).

## Associating anonymous contexts with logged-in end users

Before they log in, an end user might be represented by a device context. After they log in, they might be represented by two contexts, with one context kind based on their device and the second context kind based on their user information. This one person is now represented by two unique context keys. Both contexts are counted toward your MAU limit.

If you want to associate two contexts with each other, you can identify a multi-context that includes both individual contexts when you want the association to occur. To learn more, read [Identifying and changing contexts](/sdk/features/identify).

If you are not yet using an SDK version that supports contexts, you can associate an anonymous user with a specific, logged-in user using the `alias` method.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>This feature is not available in all SDKs</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This section explains aliasing users, which is a deprecated feature for LaunchDarkly SDKs that are part of the contexts Early Access Program (EAP). For a list of SDKs that still support this feature, read [Aliasing users](/sdk/features/aliasing-users).

</CalloutDescription>

In some cases, one person can be represented by multiple users in LaunchDarkly. If LaunchDarkly registers a person as an anonymous user, and that person later logs in to the application, LaunchDarkly registers them again as a logged-in user. This one person is now represented by two unique user keys. Both users are counted toward your MAU limit.

You can associate these two user keys by configuring your SDK to send `alias` events. `Alias` events connect two user keys and register them as one event-sending entity.

If you use Data Export or Experimentation, `alias` events are useful because they make the data represented in destinations and experiment results easier to understand. `Alias` events enable Data Export destinations to correlate the two user keys referring to the same underlying user. They also enable experiments to recognize when impressions and conversions occurred for a user, even if the user key changed between the two events.

To learn more about configuring your SDK to send `alias` events, read [Aliasing users](/sdk/features/aliasing-users).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>mParticle events require additional configuration</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you use mParticle as a Data Export destination, you must configure it to receive <code>alias</code> events in the LaunchDarkly UI. mParticle requires this additional configuration step to register events correctly.<br/><br/>
