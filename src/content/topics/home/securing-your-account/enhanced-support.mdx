## Overview

This topic explains how to enable and disable enhanced support in LaunchDarkly. Enhanced support allows us to view your account as a read-only member. This makes it easier for us to investigate issues in your LaunchDarkly account and help resolve them.

Enabling enhanced support helps us troubleshoot issues such as:

- Unexpected behavior on your **Feature flags** list
- Understanding events on the **Live events** page
- Missing contexts from your **Contexts** list
- Missing flag updates

You must have an Admin role to enable enhanced support. You can disable enhanced support at any time.

## Enabling enhanced support

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click into the **Security** tab and scroll to the "Enable enhanced support" section.
3. Check **Enable enhanced support**.
4. Choose the duration for the enhanced support:
