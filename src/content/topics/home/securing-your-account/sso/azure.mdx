## Overview

This topic explains how to integrate LaunchDarkly with Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

LaunchDarkly is included in Azure AD's App Gallery. Azure provides a LaunchDarkly application template that facilitates configuration.

## Integrating LaunchDarkly with Azure

To integrate LaunchDarkly with Azure:

1. Log in to Azure.
2. Navigate to your Enterprise applications.
3. Click **New application**:

4. Search for the LaunchDarkly application.
5. After you add it, follow the [Azure LaunchDarkly Application Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-launchdarkly-tutorial).

<CalloutDescription>

During configuration, we recommend using the identifier `user.mail`, provided that every user has their email addresses attribute set. If you haven't set attributes for every user, use the identifier `user.userprincipalname`.

## Mapping user attributes

After LaunchDarkly is integrated with Azure, you can map LaunchDarkly role and custom role attributes to Azure using Azure claims. The LaunchDarkly Azure SSO integration only provides Just-In-Time user provisioning for IdP-Initiated SSO.

To learn more about SSO provisioning for roles and custom roles, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

To set up `role` and `customRole` claims in Azure:

1. Navigate to the User Attributes & Claims section.
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Click **Add new claim**.
4. Enter "role" in the **Name** field.
5. Leave the source as "Attribute."
6. Choose a source attribute from the menu that is not currently mapped. This example uses `user.country`.
7. Click **Save**:

8. Repeat steps 1-7 with "customRole", mapping to a different unused source attribute.

<CalloutDescription>

SAML ignores empty fields if used in **Roles** or **customRoles**. To clear all existing roles, enter an empty string "" into the field.
