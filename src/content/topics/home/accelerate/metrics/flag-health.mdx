## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's flag health metric view.

Accelerate uses stale flags as an indicator of flag health. Stale flags are temporary flags that are older than 90 days and have not been evaluated in the last 7 days within a given environment.

## Understanding the flag health summary

The flag health summary includes:

- Percentage of stale flags
- Total number of stale flags
- Total number of temporary flags

## Using the stale flags list

The stale flags list shows information about flags in a selected environment that we recommend you remove.

You can use the search and filter options to refine this list into a different subset of flags.
- Search by flag maintainer, flag name, flag key, or flag description.
- Filter by flag maintainer, tags, and ready to archive or needs review.
- Sort by flag age.

You can select additional environments to compare the flag state against. This helps you verify that you can archive the flag without unintended consequences.

If you choose additional environments, LaunchDarkly performs the checks again and highlights stale flags.

### Description of checks

LaunchDarkly runs 3 checks to determine if a flag is stale. They are:

- Verify absence of code references: If you use code references and there are no references to this flag in your code, the check passes. If you do not use code references, the check does not run.
- Verify only one variation is being served: This check passes if all environments are serving the same variation as the selected environment at the top of the page.
- Verify the flag has not been requested: This check passes if the flag has not been requested in the last 7 days.

If all checks pass, you can click `Archive` to begin the Archive process.
