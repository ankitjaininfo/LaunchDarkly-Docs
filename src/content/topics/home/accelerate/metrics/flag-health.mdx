## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's flag health metric view.

Accelerate uses stale flags as an indicator of flag health. Stale flags are temporary flags older than 90 days that have a status of either "inactive" or "launched" within a given environment.

## Understanding the flag health summary

The flag health summary includes:

- Percentage of stale flags
- Total number of stale flags
- Total number of temporary flags

## Using the flag status chart

The flag status chart provides an aggregate view of your flags in your selected environment and project. 

Flags may be in one of the following statuses: 

* New
* Active
* Launched
* Inactive

For details on how these statuses are calculated, read [Flag statuses](/home/code/flag-status/#using-the-flag-status-indicator).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Launched flag status is based on evaluations</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

In Accelerate, the "launched" flag status is solely based on evaluations, so the counts displayed here may differ slightly from the **Feature flags** list.

## Using the stale flags list

The stale flags list shows information about flags in a selected environment that we recommend you remove.

You can use the search and filter options to refine this list into a different subset of flags:
- Search by flag key.
- Filter by flag maintainer, tags, and ready to archive or needs review.
- Sort by flag age.

You can select additional environments to compare the flag state against. This helps you verify that you can archive the flag without unintended consequences.

If you choose additional environments, LaunchDarkly performs the checks again and highlights stale flags.

### Description of checks

LaunchDarkly runs three checks to determine if a flag is stale. They are:

- Verify absence of code references: If you use code references and there are no references to this flag in your code, this check passes. If you do not use code references, this check does not run.
- Verify the flag has not been requested: If the flag has not been requested in the last seven days, this check passes.
- Verify only one variation is being served: If all environments are serving the same variation as the selected environment at the top of the page, this check passes.

To view additional information about these checks, click **Show archive checks**. Here's an example:

If all checks pass, you can click **Archive** to begin the archive process.
