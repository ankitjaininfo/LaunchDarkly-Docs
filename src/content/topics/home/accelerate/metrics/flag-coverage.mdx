## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's flag coverage metric view.

Accelerate defines **flag coverage** as the ratio of pull requests (PRs) that contain flag references to the total number of PRs for the selected applications. Flag coverage can be a useful way to measure flag adoption over time or across applications.

## Understanding the flag coverage summary

The flag coverage summary includes the following information:

- Percentage of PRs that include flag references
- Total PRs that include flag references
- Total PRs that do not include flag references

You can use the selection menus to narrow your view to a specific LaunchDarkly project or environment. You can also change the time period to display the last 7, 14, or 28 days, or a custom range.

## Reading the flag references chart

The pull requests with flag references chart tracks the number of PRs containing flag references as well as the number of PRs that do not contain any flag references. Hover on a data point on the flag coverage chart to display the number of PRs with and without flag references for that date.

## Using the pull requests list

The pull requests list shows information about PRs in your Github organization and what flags, if any, are affected by them. The list populates automatically in order of most recent PR.

You can use the search and filter options to refine this list into a different subset of PRs. Search by PR title, PR number, or PR author. The filter menu lets you show all PRs, or only those that do or do not affect feature flags.

### Columns in the pull request list

Here's how to read the columns in the PR list:

The "Pull request" column shows information about a PR, including its merge status, author, and a diff summary of changed lines.

Hover over an environment in the "Deployed to" field to display details about when you deployed the PR from that application to that environment.

The "PR lifespan" column shows how much time elapsed between a PR being opened and being merged. PRs that are closed without merging do not appear in this list.

The "Flags" column shows if any feature flags are affected by a PR. Hover over an updated flag to display which flags were affected. You can click any flag name to open the flag's "Targeting" page.
