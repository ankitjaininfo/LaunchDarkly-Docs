## Overview

This category contains documentation topics about LaunchDarkly's Accelerate product offering.

## Introducing Accelerate

Accelerate is a new product that enables you to track key engineering metrics in one place to improve engineering efficiency and assess team performance. By incorporating data from first commit all the way through a fully-enabled release and subsequent flag cleanup, you can highlight bottlenecks and track long-term trends.

Accelerate enables you to measure and improve metrics that focus on collective outcomes, specifically deployments and releases. It couples those metrics with data from code, build tools, incidents, and more to generate unique and useful insights for your engineering teams.

Designed to work on its own or symbiotically with LaunchDarkly's core feature management platform, Accelerate provides deployments data and code insights that make existing core product features like flag Insights, the audit log, and code references even better.

To begin using Accelerate as part of your workflow, read [Getting started with Accelerate](/home/accelerate/get-started-accelerate).

## Accelerate dashboard

Accelerate's dashboard is inspired by the original DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics of lead time to deployment, deployment frequency, mean time to recovery, and change failure rate. Together, these metrics were developed to show how your organization balances speed and stability.

However, if your engineering team uses feature management, this singular focus on deployments makes the DORA metrics incomplete. The most efficient engineering teams reduce risk by decoupling releases from deployments. To understand the full picture of how and when changes are going out to your customers, you need to track and measure both deployments and releases, so that you know when code changes are going out to customers and when feature flag changes are being enabled for them as well.

The Accelerate dashboard can help you track and measure these and other important metrics. To learn more, read [Accelerate dashboard metrics](/home/accelerate/accelerate-metrics).
