## Overview

This topic explains how to set up projects, environments, and applications, and begin using Accelerate.

## Concepts

You should understand the following concepts before you set up your Accelerate dashboard.

### Projects and environments

Accelerate uses all the same projects and environments that you've already set up as part of your feature management. Projects let you manage multiple different business objectives from one LaunchDarkly account. Environments are organizational units contained within projects. They allow you to manage your feature flags throughout your development lifecycle.

To learn more, read [Projects](/home/organize/projects) and [Environments](/home/organize/environments).

### Applications

Applications are a part of your codebase for which you want to track deployments. Applications usually correspond to a single repository in your version control system. To learn more, read [Applications](/home/accelerate/get-started-accelerate/applications).

## Get started

To get started using Accelerate, first reach out to your Early Access Program (EAP) account contact and confirm that Accelerate is enabled for your account.

After you are part of the EAP program, you can access Accelerate from the product switcher menu in the LaunchDarkly user interface.

From your feature flag list, click the product switcher menu and choose **Accelerate**:

The release frequency and flag health metrics are available as soon as you access Accelerate. They don't need any additional configuration. To learn more, read [Release frequency](/home/accelerate/accelerate-metrics/release) and [Flag health](/home/accelerate/accelerate-metrics/flag-health).

To enable other metrics, follow the instructions in the "Welcome to Accelerate" dialog. The setup instructions guide you through configuring deployment information, installing the GitHub app, and setting up code references:

You can click the **arrow** icon next to each step to view detailed instructions. Alternatively, you can follow the instructions below:

1. [Send deployment information to Accelerate](/home/accelerate/config-deployment-accelerate)
2. [Install the GitHub app](/home/accelerate/github-app-accelerate)
3. [Set up code references](/home/accelerate/code-refs-accelerate)

After you complete these steps, you can confirm your setup.

## Confirm your setup

To confirm you have set up everything correctly:

- Check for data on the [Deployment frequency](/home/accelerate/accelerate-metrics/deployment) metric view. After you have set up and sent at least one deployment event, the deployment frequency chart and the deployments table will start filling with data.

- Check for data on the [Lead time](/home/accelerate/accelerate-metrics/lead-time) metric view. After you have set up the GitHub app, Accelerate will start receiving commit and pull request (PR) information for all future PRs. Accelerate will also backfill events for the last 90 days, although this can take up to 24 hours to complete. The lead time chart and the pull requests list will start filling with data.
