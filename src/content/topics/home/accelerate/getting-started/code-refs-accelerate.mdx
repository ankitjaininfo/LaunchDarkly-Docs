## Overview

This topic explains how to set up code references for Accelerate.

Accelerate uses code references to associate flags with code-based changes such as pull requests and deployments. These associations let Accelerate calculate usage metrics and increase the accuracy of the flag health metric. To learn more, read [Flag health](/home/accelerate/accelerate-metrics/flag-health).

## Set up code references

Set up code references for each codebase in which you use flags.

Until you configure it, the application will prompt you to set up code references.

Click **Set up** to view the instructions or **Dismiss** to hide the prompt. If you dismiss the prompt, you can still read the instructions for setting up code references using the **Get started** button at the bottom of the screen, or by clicking your **display picture** and selecting "Setup."

To learn how to set up code references, read [Code references](/home/code/code-references).

## Additional Accelerate setup

To finish setting up Accelerate, you may also need to [Send deployment information to Accelerate](/home/accelerate/config-deployment-accelerate) and [Install the GitHub app](/home/accelerate/github-app-accelerate). To learn more, read [Confirm your setup](/home/accelerate/get-started-accelerate#confirm-your-setup).
