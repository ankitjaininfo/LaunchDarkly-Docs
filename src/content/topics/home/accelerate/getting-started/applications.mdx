## Overview

This topic explains how to work with applications in Accelerate.

Applications are a part of your code base for which you want to track deployments. Applications often correspond to a single repository in your version control system. However, if you are using monorepos, then a single repository may contain several applications. Generally, if you independently deploy a codebase or portion of a codebase, it's considered an application in Accelerate.

## Creating applications

Applications are created automatically when you send a deployment event to Accelerate. Deployment events must include the application key and version. If the application key does not correspond to an existing application, Accelerate will create a new application for you using that key.

To learn how to send a deployment event to Accelerate, read [Deployment events API](/home/accelerate/get-started-accelerate/deployment-events-api).

## Editing applications

You can change the display name or description for an application. The application key cannot be edited.

To edit an application:

1. Find the **Filter applications** menu either on the **Overview** page or on any of the metric view pages.
2. Select "Manage applications" from the bottom of the menu. The **Applications** list appears.

4. Edit the **Name** or **Description**.
5. Select **Save application**.

## Deleting applications

To delete an application:

1. Find the **Filter applications** menu either on the **Overview** page or on any of the metric view pages.
2. Select "Manage applications" from the bottom of the menu. The **Applications** list appears.
3. Find the application you want to delete in the list.
4. Click the **overflow menu** and choose "Delete application."
5. Click **Delete** on the confirmation dialog to confirm deletion of the application.
