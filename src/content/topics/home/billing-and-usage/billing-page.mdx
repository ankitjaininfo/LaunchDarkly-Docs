## Overview

This topic explains the information on the **Billing** tab and how to upgrade or add on services.

## Understanding the Billing tab

The **Billing** tab includes the following information:

- Your account ID.
- Your total seat usage.
- Your total client-side monthly active users (MAU) or client-side monthly context instances (MCI), depending on your billing model. To learn more, read [Calculating client-side monthly active users (MAU)](/home/billing/usage-metrics#calculating-client-side-monthly-active-users-mau) and [Calculating client-side monthly context instances (MCI)](/home/billing/usage-metrics#starting-april-1-2023-calculating-client-side-monthly-context-instances-mci).

<CalloutDescription>

On April 1, 2023, LaunchDarkly will introduce a new format of calculating billing and usage: monthly context instances, or MCI. We have provided documentation about MCI in this topic to help you prepare for any changes to your billing, but this change will not affect you until April 1 at the earliest. Some customers will be affected when their plan renews, but no one will be affected before April 1, 2023.<br /><br />

For more information about MCI and how this update impacts your LaunchDarkly plan, read <a href="#starting-april-1-2023-calculating-client-side-monthly-context-instances-mci">Calculating client-side monthly context instances (MCI)</a>.
