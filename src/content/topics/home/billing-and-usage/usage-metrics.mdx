## Overview

This topic explains how to understand the billing and usage metrics visualized in the **Account settings** page. It introduces the concept of monthly active users (MAU) and monthly context instances (MCI), which are numbers of unique identifiers designated in your LaunchDarkly plan.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly's billing calculations will change on April 1, 2023</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

On April 1, 2023, LaunchDarkly will introduce a new format of calculating billing and usage: monthly context instances, or MCI. We have provided documentation about MCI in this topic to help you prepare for any changes to your billing, but this change will not affect you until April 1 at the earliest. Some customers will be affected when their plan renews, but no one will be affected before April 1, 2023.<br /><br />

For more information about MCI and how this update impacts your LaunchDarkly plan, read <a href="#starting-april-1-2023-calculating-client-side-monthly-context-instances-mci">Calculating client-side monthly context instances (MCI)</a>.

## Understanding usage metrics

Usage metrics are located on the **Usage** tab under **Account settings**. These usage metrics tell you more about how your application and members of your organization are using LaunchDarkly.

Here is an image of the **Overview** subtab under **Usage**:

![The "Usage" tab.](settings-usage.png)

The **Usage** tab includes the following subtabs:

- **Overview**: displays how many seats, client-side MAU, Experimentation events, Data Export events, and server connections your organization is using.
- **Client**: displays client-side MAU and client connections. You can narrow the views by project/environment, context kind, SDK type, SDK name, or date range. The users in your MAU count are automatically removed after 30 days of inactivity. To learn more, read [Calculating client-side monthly active users (MAU)](/home/billing/usage-metrics#calculating-client-side-monthly-active-users-mau).
- **Experiments**: if you use Experimentation, displays Experimentation keys and Experimentation units over the selected time or date range. You can narrow the views by context kind, project/environment, or date range. To learn more about pricing, read [Experiment pricing](/home/about-experimentation#experiment-pricing).
- **Data Export**: If you use Data Export, displays Data Export usage over the selected time or date range. You can narrow the views by or date range.
- **Server**: displays server-side MAU and server connections. You can narrow the views by date range, SDK, or project and environment. The users in your MAU count are automatically removed after 30 days of inactivity. LaunchDarkly does not bill for server-side MAU.

### Understanding project and account MAU

Project MAU and account MAU are not always the same number. MAU charts count unique users for a specific project or environment. Users can be active in multiple projects or environments, contributing to the unique user counts in each. The **Overview** tab shows the unique client MAU at the account level, while the **Client** tab can show all the unique MAU from each named project or from each named environment.

For example, you may have 10,000 contexts in Project A and 10,000 contexts in Project B, but if there is any overlap in the user base your account will have fewer than 20,000 total unique user keys.

Here's a diagram showing the overlap in contexts between Project A and Project B:

![A Venn diagram depicting how different sets of user keys can overlap.](usage-metrics-venn-diagram.png)

Here's how many keys each project might have:

- 3,000 unique keys in Project A
- 3,000 unique keys in Project B
- 7,000 keys that exist in both Projects A and B
- 13,000 total unique keys

## Calculating client-side monthly active users (MAU)

LaunchDarkly calculates client-side MAU as unique user contexts that evaluate, initialize, or identify any flag from a client-side SDK over a rolling 30-day period. The amount of these user contexts is designated per account.

Your usage is based on the total number of unique client-side user contexts across your entire account, regardless of anonymity or whether the context is currently visible on the **Contexts** list. Uniqueness is defined as unique user context `key`s. Custom attributes do not affect client-side MAU uniqueness. LaunchDarkly does not bill for server-side MAU.

## Starting April 1, 2023: Calculating client-side monthly context instances (MCI)

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>You will not be billed for MCI before April 1, 2023</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The documentation in this section is provided to help you plan for and understand upcoming changes to how we calculate usage. It will not apply to any customer plans until April 1, 2023.<br /><br />

On April 1, 2023, LaunchDarkly usage will be calculated using monthly context instances (MCI). However, not all customers will be affected by this change on April 1, 2023. Depending on your plan type, you may charged with MCI at a different time.<br /><br />

Here's how different plan types are affected by this change:<br /><br />

<ul>
 <li>If you are on a Starter or Pro plan, your bill will be calculated with MCI starting on April 1, 2023</li>
 <li>If you are on an Enterprise plan, your bill will be calculated with MCI when it renews, but not before April 1, 2023</li>
</ul>

If you are unsure about how you will be billed, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/) or your LaunchDarkly Account Executive.

LaunchDarkly calculates client-side MCI as unique context instances that evaluate, initialize, or identify any flag from a client-side SDK over a rolling 30-day period. The amount of these context instances is designated per account.

Your usage is based on the total number of unique client-side context instances across your entire account, regardless of anonymity or whether the context is currently visible on the **Contexts** list. Uniqueness is defined as unique pairs of context kinds and `key`s. Custom attributes do not affect client-side MCI uniqueness. LaunchDarkly does not bill for server-side MCI.

LaunchDarkly bills for client-side context instances in the following ways:

- Each unique context instance counts as one client-side MCI.
- A context instance can be just one context, or a group of contexts that LaunchDarkly evaluates together as a multi-context. LaunchDarkly bills multi-contexts as one client-side MCI.
- If you add or remove a context from an existing multi-context, LaunchDarkly considers the new context instance unique and counts it as an additional client-side MCI.
- If you change an existing context's key, LaunchDarkly considers the new context instance unique and counts it as an additional client-side MCI.
- If a context contains a single context, such as a "user," but has multiple `key`s, each unique `key` counts as one client-side MCI.

To learn more, read [Understanding contexts and context kinds](/home/contexts#understanding-contexts-and-context-kinds).

Here are examples of evaluation contexts, and how LaunchDarkly would count them toward client-side MCI:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="A single context">

```json
// LaunchDarkly counts this as one client-side MCI
Context = {
  "kind": "user",
  "key": "context-key-123abc"
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="A multi-context">

```json
// LaunchDarkly counts this as one client-side MCI
Context = {
  "kind": "multi",
  "user": { "key": "user-key-123abc" },
  "organization": { "key": "org-key-123abc" }
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="A context with two evaluations">

```json
// If a single context is later used as part of a multi-context,
// LaunchDarkly counts it as two client-side MCI

// For example, here's a single context before the end user logs in:
Context = {
  "kind": "device",
  "key": "device-key-123abc"
}

// Here's the corresponding multi-context after the end user logs in,
// LaunchDarkly counts this as a second client-side MCI:
Context = {
  "kind": "multi",
  "device": { "key": "device-key-123abc" },
  "user": { "key": "user-key-123abc" }
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If contexts evaluate flags in your Relay Proxy, we also count each context instance as one client-side MCI over the 30-day period.

### Understanding client-side MCI limits

Your LaunchDarkly plan includes a client-side MCI limit. We understand that a company's user base can grow unexpectedly over time. We never stop or throttle service if you exceed your client-side MCI limit, nor do we bill you for client-side MCI overages. All contexts will continue to receive feature flags correctly, regardless of the amount of your client-side MCI.

Context instances live on the **Contexts** list for 30 days from their last evaluation. If you exceed your client-side MCI limit, LaunchDarkly will begin deleting the oldest context instances on the list to make room for new context instances, even if they are not yet more than 30 days old. LaunchDarkly continues to delete old context instances as new ones are added to keep the list at no more than your contracted limit.

If you have configured LaunchDarkly to use anonymous contexts, that can impact your client-side MCI as well. To learn more, read [Managing anonymous contexts and MAU](/home/contexts/anonymous-contexts#managing-anonymous-contexts-and-mau).
