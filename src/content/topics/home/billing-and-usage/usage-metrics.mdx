## Overview

This topic explains how to understand the billing and usage metrics visualized in the **Account settings** page. It introduces the concept of monthly context instances (MCI), which are numbers of unique identifiers designated in your LaunchDarkly plan.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly's billing calculations changed on April 1, 2023</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

On April 1, 2023, LaunchDarkly introduced a new format of calculating billing and usage: monthly context instances, or MCI. MCI replaces monthly active users, or MAU. We have provided documentation about MCI in this topic to help you understand any changes to your billing, but this change may not affect you before your plan renews.<br /><br />

For more information about MCI and how this update impacts your LaunchDarkly plan, read <a href="#calculating-client-side-mci">Calculating client-side MCI</a>.

## Understanding usage metrics

Usage metrics are located on the **Usage** tab under **Account settings**. These usage metrics tell you more about how your application and members of your organization are using LaunchDarkly. Depending on what plan you're on, the usage tab may show MCI or MAU.

You can also use the REST API: [Account usage](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Account-usage-(beta)/)

### Understanding project and account MCI

Project MCI and account MCI are not always the same number. MCI charts count unique users for a specific project or environment. Users can be active in multiple projects or environments, contributing to the unique user counts in each. The **Overview** tab shows the unique client MCI at the account level, while the **Client** tab can show all the unique MCI from each named project or from each named environment.

For example, you may have 10,000 contexts in Project A and 10,000 contexts in Project B, but if there is any overlap in the user base your account will have fewer than 20,000 total unique user keys.

Here's a diagram showing the overlap in contexts between Project A and Project B:

![A Venn diagram depicting how different sets of user keys can overlap.](usage-metrics-venn-diagram.png)

Here's how many keys each project might have:

- 3,000 unique keys in Project A
- 3,000 unique keys in Project B
- 7,000 keys that exist in both Projects A and B
- 13,000 total unique keys

## Calculating client-side MCI

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>You may be billed for MCI after April 1, 2023</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

On April 1, 2023, LaunchDarkly started calculating usage based on monthly context instances (MCI). However, this change may not affect you before your plan renews.<br /><br />

Here's how different plan types are affected by this change:<br /><br />

<ul>
 <li>If you are on a Starter or Pro plan, your bill will be calculated with MCI</li>
 <li>If you are on an Enterprise plan, your bill will be calculated with MCI when it renews</li>
</ul>

If you are unsure about how you are being billed, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/) or your LaunchDarkly Account Executive.

LaunchDarkly calculates client-side MCI as unique context instances that evaluate, initialize, or identify any flag from a client-side SDK over a rolling 30-day period. The amount of these context instances is designated per account.

Your usage is based on the total number of unique client-side context instances across your entire account, regardless of anonymity or whether the context is currently visible on the **Contexts** list. Uniqueness is defined as unique pairs of context kinds and `key`s. Custom attributes do not affect client-side MCI uniqueness. LaunchDarkly does not bill for server-side MCI.

LaunchDarkly bills for client-side context instances in the following ways:

- Each unique context instance counts as one client-side MCI.
- A context instance can be just one context, or a group of contexts that LaunchDarkly evaluates together as a multi-context. LaunchDarkly bills multi-contexts as one client-side MCI.
- If you add or remove a context from an existing multi-context, LaunchDarkly considers the new context instance unique and counts it as an additional client-side MCI.
- If you change an existing context's key, LaunchDarkly considers the new context instance unique and counts it as an additional client-side MCI.
- If a context contains a single context, such as a "user," but has multiple `key`s, each unique `key` counts as one client-side MCI.

To learn more, read [Understanding contexts and context kinds](/home/contexts#understanding-contexts-and-context-kinds).

Here are examples of evaluation contexts, and how LaunchDarkly would count them toward client-side MCI:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="A single context">

```json
// LaunchDarkly counts this as one client-side MCI
Context = {
  "kind": "user",
  "key": "context-key-123abc"
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="A multi-context">

```json
// LaunchDarkly counts this as one client-side MCI
Context = {
  "kind": "multi",
  "user": { "key": "user-key-123abc" },
  "organization": { "key": "org-key-123abc" }
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="A context with two evaluations">

```json
// If a single context is later used as part of a multi-context,
// LaunchDarkly counts it as two client-side MCI

// For example, here's a single context before the end user logs in:
Context = {
  "kind": "device",
  "key": "device-key-123abc"
}

// Here's the corresponding multi-context after the end user logs in,
// LaunchDarkly counts this as a second client-side MCI:
Context = {
  "kind": "multi",
  "device": { "key": "device-key-123abc" },
  "user": { "key": "user-key-123abc" }
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

If contexts evaluate flags in your Relay Proxy, we also count each context instance as one client-side MCI over the 30-day period.

### Understanding client-side MCI limits

Your LaunchDarkly plan includes a client-side MCI limit. We understand that a company's user base can grow unexpectedly over time. We never stop or throttle service if you exceed your client-side MCI limit, nor do we bill you for client-side MCI overages. All contexts will continue to receive feature flags correctly, regardless of the amount of your client-side MCI.

Context instances live on the **Contexts** list for 30 days from their last evaluation. If you exceed your client-side MCI limit, LaunchDarkly will begin deleting the oldest context instances on the list to make room for new context instances, even if they are not yet more than 30 days old. LaunchDarkly continues to delete old context instances as new ones are added to keep the list at no more than your contracted limit.

If you have configured LaunchDarkly to use anonymous contexts, that can impact your client-side MCI as well. To learn more, read [Managing anonymous contexts and MCI](/home/contexts/anonymous-contexts#managing-anonymous-contexts-and-mci).
