## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's approvals feature to request review for changes you plan to make to a flag. It also explains how to review an approval request when you are asked to.

You can customize an environment's approval settings in the **Environments** tab of a project under the **Account settings** page. To learn more, read [Configuring approvals by environment](/home/managing-flags/feature-workflows/environment-approvals).

## Understanding approvals

When an account member plans a flag change, they have the option to request approval for that change from a member or team in their LaunchDarkly project. Approvals let more people have input on planned changes to a flag. These review-style approvals mimic common code review workflows, such as pull request (PR) reviews in GitHub.

Anyone with a Writer, Admin, Owner, or custom role with `reviewApprovalRequest` permission can approve a flag change, regardless of whether or not their review has been requested. Account members and team members who the requester chooses receive an email notifying them that their review has been requested, and, if applicable, a notification in the LaunchDarkly Slack app.

## Requesting approvals

You can request approval on changes to a flag's targeting from any member or team within your LaunchDarkly organization. You can do this any time after you create a flag. Members that do not have permission to approve requests can still view the change.

Here's how:

1. Make a change to any flag.
2. Click the **dropdown icon** in the **Review and save** button. The additional actions menu appears:

   ![The "Review and save" button with the additional actions menu expanded.](approvals-request-menu.png)

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Your environment may require approvals</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If your environment requires approvals, **Review and request approval** is the default option. To learn more, read [Configuring approvals by environment](/home/feature-workflows/environment-approvals).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

3. Click "Request approval." The "Request approval" dialog appears.

![The "Request approval" dialog.](approvals-request.png)

4. Review and confirm the changes displayed in the dialog. If you need to make changes, click **Edit** next to the pencil icon.
5. Enter a **Description** to add details that help your reviewers understand the changes you made.
6. Choose one or more reviewers from the **Reviewers** menu.
7. Click **Request approval**. The approval request appears.

Reviewers receive an email, an in-app inbox notification, and, if they use the LaunchDarkly Slack app, a Slack notification asking them to approve your flag changes.

The flag's **Targeting** tab also updates with a number next to the **Pending changes** icon to indicate that there are pending changes waiting for review:

### Requesting approval for copying flags

When you copy flag settings between environments, if the environment you're copying changes to requires approval, then **Review and request approval** is the default option. To learn more, read [Comparing and copying flag settings between two environments](/home/code/flag-compare-copy#comparing-and-copying-flag-settings-between-two-environments) and [Configuring approvals by environment](/home/feature-workflows/environment-approvals).

## Viewing flag approval requests

If someone requests your approval on a flag change, the request appears in the Approval dashboard and in the pending changes drawer on a flag's **Targeting** tab.

You will receive an email, an in-app inbox notification, and, if you use the LaunchDarkly Slack app, a Slack notification. You can click through to view and approve or decline the request from any of these notifications.

## Approving and declining changes

You can comment on, approve, and decline flag changes from the approval request details screen.

Here are the actions you can take during your review:

- **Approve and apply changes**: Approve the changes and apply them immediately. The "Review history" section updates to indicate that you reviewed the change request, and the requestor receives an email notification. If scheduled for a future date, the change will apply at the scheduled date and time.
- **Approve changes**: Approve the changes without applying them. The original requester, or any account member with a Writer, Admin, Owner, or appropriate custom role can apply the changes you approved.
- **Decline changes**: Deny the changes.
- **Comment only**: Leave a comment on the requested flag changes.

![The approval request details screen.](approval-request-details.png)

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Anyone with role access can leave a comment</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Anyone with role access can comment on an approval request. This includes the requestor, as well as anyone with a role of Writer, Admin, Owner, or anyone with a custom role that can review approval requests.

The only time someone with access cannot comment on an approval request is after the request has been applied. Applying an approval request freezes the approval request page to preserve the state it was in when the change was applied.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Only member accounts can approve and apply changes to an approval request. Approvals do not support service tokens.
