## Overview

This topic explains how to create and delete approval requests.

## Creating an approval request

You can request approval on changes to a flag's targeting or variations from any member or team within your LaunchDarkly organization. You can do this any time after you create a flag. Members that do not have permission to approve requests can still view the change.

Here's how:

1. Make a change to any flag.
2. Click the **dropdown icon** in the **Review and save** button. The additional actions menu appears:

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Your environment may require approvals</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If your environment requires approvals, **Review and request approval** is the default option. To learn more, read [Configuring approvals for an environment](/home/feature-workflows/environment-approvals).

</CalloutDescription>

3. Click "Request approval." The "Save changes" dialog appears.

4. Review and confirm the changes displayed in the dialog.
5. Enter a **Reason** to add details that help your reviewers understand the changes you made.
6. Choose one or more reviewers from the **Reviewers** menu.
7. Click **Request approval**. The approval request appears.

Reviewers receive an email, an in-app inbox notification, and, if they use the LaunchDarkly Slack or Microsoft Teams app, a Slack or Teams notification asking them to approve your flag changes.

The flag's **Targeting** tab also updates with a number next to the **Pending changes** icon to indicate that there are pending changes waiting for review:

### Required approvals

Enterprise customers can require approval requests for specific environments.

If your environment requires approvals, then when you make a flag change, **Review and request approval** is the default option.

When you copy flag settings between environments, if the environment you're copying changes to requires approval, then **Review and request approval** is the default option. To learn more, read [Comparing and copying flag settings between two environments](/home/code/flag-compare-copy#comparing-and-copying-flag-settings-between-two-environments) and [Configuring approvals for an environment](/home/feature-workflows/environment-approvals).

You can also use the REST API: [Create approval request to copy flag configurations across environments](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Approvals/#operation/postFlagCopyConfigApprovalRequest)

## Deleting an approval request

You may delete your request for changes to a flag at any point before the changes are applied. You can do this in several ways:

- from the Approval dashboard, or
- from the "Pending changes" panel, or
- from the approval request.
