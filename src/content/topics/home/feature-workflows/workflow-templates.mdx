## Overview

This topic explains how to create and use workflow templates to automate your rollouts at scale. It describes how to save workflows as templates that can be reused with other flags.

## Using workflow templates

If your organization follows a standard procedure for rolling out feature flags, you can turn your custom workflow into a template so other account members can use it. Workflow templates are saved versions of workflows that you can apply and use with any flags in your account.


### Understanding how workflow templates are applied across flags

You can apply workflow templates to any flag in any environment or project, regardless of which environment or project you create them in.

When you apply a template to a different flag or environment from where it was created, any environment or flag specific pieces of the workflow, such as variations, segments, or contexts are cleared. LaunchDarkly prompts you to fill in these blanks with appropriate values for the new flag and environment.

## Saving a workflow as a template

Here is how to save a workflow as a template:

1. Navigate to a feature flag.
2. Click on the **Workflows** tab.
3. Click the **Build a custom workflow** button. 
4. Build the workflow with the steps that youâ€™d like each flag to follow.
5. Click **Save as template**.
6. Give the template a name, a key, and add an optional description. Then click **Next**.
7. Click **Start workflow** if you would also like to run the workflow on the flag.


## Applying templates to flags
