## Overview

This topic explains how to review, approve, and decline approval requests.

## Viewing flag approval requests

If someone requests your approval on a flag change, the request appears in the Approval dashboard and in the flag's "Pending changes" panel.

You will receive an email, an in-app inbox notification, and, if you use the LaunchDarkly Slack or Microsoft Teams app, a Slack or Teams notification. You can click through to view and approve or decline the request from any of these notifications.

By default, the Approval dashboard is filtered to show approval requests on which you have been requested as a reviewer, and are pending review. To see other approval requests, you can edit the filters to change the views on this screen.

### Viewing approval requests from email

2. In the message body, click **Review request** to open the approval request details screen in LaunchDarkly.

### Viewing approval requests from Slack or Microsoft Teams

If you use the LaunchDarkly Slack or Microsoft Teams app, you will receive a notification of each approval request through that app.

To learn more, read [Viewing approvals in Slack](/integrations/slack/approvals#viewing-approvals-in-slack) and [Viewing approvals in Microsoft Teams](/integrations/microsoft-teams/approvals#viewing-approvals-in-microsoft-teams).

## Approving and declining changes

You can comment on, approve, and decline flag changes from the approval request details screen.

Here are the actions you can take during your review:

- **Approve and apply changes**: Approve the changes and apply them immediately. The "Review history" section updates to indicate that you reviewed the change request, and the requestor receives an email notification. If scheduled for a future date, the change will apply at the scheduled date and time.
- **Approve changes**: Approve the changes without applying them. The original requester, or any account member with a Writer, Admin, Owner, or appropriate custom role can apply the changes you approved.
- **Decline changes**: Deny the changes.
- **Comment only**: Leave a comment on the requested flag changes.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Anyone with role access can leave a comment</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Members and service tokens with role access can comment on an approval request, including: 

- the requestor, 
- members with a role of Writer, Admin, or Owner, 
- members with a custom role that can review approval requests, and
- requests using service tokens with a role that can review approval requests.

The only time someone with access cannot comment on an approval request is after the request has been applied. Applying an approval request freezes the approval request page to preserve the state it was in when the change was applied.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Member accounts and service tokens have permission to approve and apply changes to an approval request.
