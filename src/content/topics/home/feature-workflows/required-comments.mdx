## Overview

This topic explains how to use required comments for feature flag changes.

Comments help establish a change history for a feature flag. Requiring members to leave comments when they change flags or segments helps your organization understand why flags or segments look and behave certain ways.

<CalloutTitle>Required comments are only enforced from the flags list</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When **Require comments** is enabled, members must leave a comment to explain their changes when they make changes from the flags list in the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI). Comments are not required for changes made with the LaunchDarkly API.

When you require comments in an environment, members must leave a comment when saving any changes to a flag:
