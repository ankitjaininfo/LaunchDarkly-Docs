## Overview

This topic explains how to interpret an experiment's results and apply its findings to your product.

## Understanding experiments as they run

When your experiments are running, you can view information about them on the **Experiments** list or on the related flag's **Experimentation** tab. The **Experimentation** tab displays all the experiments a flag is participating in, including both experiments that are currently recording and experiments that are stopped.

Here are some things you can do with each experiment:

- Stop the experiment or start a new iteration. To learn more, read [Managing experiments](/home/analyzing-experiments/managing).
- Edit the metrics connected to the experiment and start a new iteration.
- View experiment data over set periods of time on the **Iterations** tab:

## Reading experiment data

The data an experiment has collected is represented in a results tab.

The results tab includes information about attribute filters, experiment traffic, sample ratios, and a graph representing the results:

To learn more about interpreting an experiment's results, read [Reading experiment results](/home/analyzing-experiments/results).

## Choosing a winning variation

The winning variation for a completed experiment is the variation that is most likely to be the best option out of all of the variations tested. To learn more, read [Winning variations](/home/analyzing-experiments/winning-variation).

<CalloutDescription>

If you're done with an experiment and have rolled out the winning variation to your user base, it is a good time to stop your experiment. Experiments running on a user base that only receives one flag variation do not return useful results. Stopping an experiment retains all the data collected so far.

## Further analyzing results

If you're using Data Export, you can find experiment data in your Data Export destinations to further analyze it using third-party tools of your own.

To learn more, read [Data Export](/home/data-export).
