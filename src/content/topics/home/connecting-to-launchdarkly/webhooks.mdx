## Overview

Webhooks are a mechanism for real-time communication between different systems or applications. They allow one application to send automated HTTP requests to another application when a specific event or trigger occurs. 

With LaunchDarkly's webhooks, you have the freedom to create custom integrations that can subscribe to changes within the LaunchDarkly platform. Whenever a modification occurs, such as an update to a feature flag or an invitation sent to a new account member, LaunchDarkly promptly dispatches an HTTP POST payload to the URL configured for the webhook. This seamless communication ensures that your integrated systems stay up-to-date with the latest changes happening in LaunchDarkly.

Use webhooks to update external issue trackers, update support tickets, notify customers of new feature rollouts, and more.

You can manage webhooks programmatically using the REST API. Checkout [Webhooks](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Webhooks/) page in API documentation.

## Creating a webhook

To create a webhook:

1. Navigate to the [Integrations](https://app.launchdarkly.com/integrations) page.
2. Navigate to the "Webhooks" section and click **Add integration**. The "Create a webhook" panel appears.
3. (Optional) Give the webhook a human-readable **Name**.
4. Enter an absolute **URL**.
5. If you want the webhook to be signed, check the **Sign this webhook** checkbox. To learn more, read [Signing webhooks](#signing-webhooks).
6. Add a policy if you want to select and filter the events sent to the webhook. To learn more, read [Adding a policy filter](#adding-a-policy-filter).
7. After reading the Terms and Conditions, check the **I have read and agree to the Integration Terms and Conditions** checkbox.
8. Click **Save settings**:

## Signing webhooks

When creating a webhook, you can define an optional secret. If defined, the webhook `POST` request will include an `X-LD-Signature` header, whose value will contain an HMAC SHA256 hex digest of the webhook payload, using the secret as the key.

Compute the signature of the payload using the same shared secret in your code to verify that the webhook was triggered by LaunchDarkly.

Here is an image of the "Create a webhook" configuration panel:

You can use the auto-generated secret, or supply your own when creating or editing a webhook.

## Adding a policy filter

LaunchDarkly sends all flag change events in the production environment to a webhook by default. To customize the events LaunchDarkly sends to a webhook, use the policy editor in the webhook creation panel. To learn more about creating a policy, read [Example policies and templates](/home/members/example-policies).

For example, to receive an event only when a change is made to one of your production feature flags, add the following policy to your webhook:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Example webhook policy">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/production:flag/*"]
  }
]
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Here is an image of the webhook configuration panel, configured with a policy:

You can also use the REST API: [Update webhook](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Webhooks#operation/patchWebhook)

## Payload format

The webhook payload format is identical to the entry format for the [audit log](/home/flags/audit-log-history). Read our [REST API Documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Webhooks) for an example payload.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Webhook delivery order</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Note that webhooks may not be delivered in chronological order. We recommend using the payload's "date" field as a timestamp to reorder webhooks as they are received.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Retries

If LaunchDarkly receives a non-2xx response to a webhook `POST`, it attempts to retry the delivery once. Webhook delivery is not guaranteed, and integrations built on webhooks should be tolerant of delivery failures.

## Disabling webhooks

You can temporarily disable a webhook by hitting the On/Off switch on the [Integrations](https://app.launchdarkly.com/integrations) page.

## Testing webhooks

To leverage webhooks, you need to deploy a service on a server-endpoint. However, the setup process for a server-endpoint can be time-consuming. If you seek to refine and test your implementation before writing the actual service code, an alternative solution is to utilize no-code tools such as [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/) or [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/). These tools are HTTP catch-all, gives you an URL endpoint, and allow inspection of incoming payloads from LaunchDarkly to enable the design and testing of webhook implementation without immediate service code development.

## Deleting webhooks

You can delete a webhook when you no longer need it.

To delete a webhook:

1. Navigate to the [**Integrations**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/integrations) page.
2. Navigate to the "Webhooks" section.
3. Click the **expand arrows** next to the **Add integration** button.

![The "Add integration" button with the expand arrows called out.](manage-integrations-expand-arrow-callout.png)

4. Click the **pencil** icon next to the webhook you want to delete. The "Edit webhook" panel appears.
5. Click **Delete webhook**. A confirmation dialog appears.
6. Click **Delete**.
