## Overview

This topic explains how to build and manage Big Segments. Big Segments let you target large groups of users by attribute.

A Big Segment is a kind of segment that is backed by an external data store. Big Segments can support massive numbers of targets. A standard user segment is capped at 15,000 users, but the cap for a Big Segment is only limited by the data store you configure.

To learn how to create a Big Segment, read [Creating user segments](/home/users/segments#creating-user-segments).

## Prerequisites

To use Big Segments, you must meet the following prerequisites:

### You must configure server-side SDKs to use Big Segments

How you need to configure your SDKs depends on what kinds of SDKs you use:
- **Server-side SDKs**: You must use an SDK version that supports Big Segments. To learn more, read the [SDK documentation on Big Segments](/sdk/features/big-segments).
- **Client-side SDKs**: All client-side SDKs support Big Segments by default. No additional setup is required.

### You must properly configure the Relay Proxy to use Big Segments with server-side SDKs

How you need to configure the Relay Proxy depends on what kinds of SDKs you use:
- **Server-side SDKs**: You must use the Relay Proxy and it must be configured to use Big Segments.
- **Client-side SDKs**: The Relay Proxy is not required. However, if you do use the Relay Proxy, you must configure it to use Big Segments. To learn more, read [Using the Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy/using).

## Configuring Big Segments

There are two ways to add users to a Big Segment:

- Sync the Big Segment from an Amplitude cohort
- Add user targets to the Big Segment from a CSV or individually

A segment can use one of these two methods, but not both.

## Syncing Big Segments from Amplitude

You can sync Big Segments from an Amplitude cohort. When you sync your Amplitude cohort to the LaunchDarkly destination in the Amplitude dashboard, it creates a synced segment. This allows the segment to contain a large number of users from Amplitude.

To learn more, read [Syncing Big Segments from Amplitude cohorts](/home/users/synced-segments).

## Adding user targets to Big Segments

You can import user targets to a Big Segment using a CSV file. After you populate a Big Segment with user targets, you can then add or remove individual users.

### Importing users from a CSV file

To import users from a CSV file:

1. Navigate to the Big Segment you wish to import users into.

2. Click **Upload CSV**. An "Upload CSV" dialog appears.

If the Big Segment already contains users, you have the option to merge or overwrite the existing users with the users from the CSV file.
 - Select "Overwrite" to replace all existing users in the segment
 - Select "Merge" to add to the existing users in the segment

3. Click **Select File**.
4. Select a CSV file from your computer.
5. Click **Upload File**.

The import process begins in the background. When the import completes successfully, you receive an email notification. Depending on the number of users in the CSV, this may take several minutes or hours.

You can also use the REST API: [Create Big Segment import](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Segments-(beta)#operation/createBigSegmentImport)

There are some limitations to the import feature. They are:

- The imported CSV file must not contain a header row. LaunchDarkly reads user keys from the first column of the CSV file. For example:

- LaunchDarkly does not support concurrent imports within a single environment.
- Uploaded CSV files may not exceed 40MB in size and may not contain more than 1 million users. If you want to add more than 1 million users, you can use the "Merge" option with multiple sequential file uploads.

### Adding and removing individual users

After you add user targets to a Big Segment using a CSV file, you can then add or remove individual users. 

To add or remove individual users to or from a Big Segment:

1. Navigate to the desired segment.
2. In the **Included users** search box, enter the key of the user you want to add or remove. If the user is present in the segment, a **Remove user** button appears. If the user is not present in the segment, an **Add user** button appears.

3. Click **Add user** or **Remove user**.
4. Click **Review and save**. A "Review and save" dialog appears.

5. Click **Save changes**.

## Exporting users

To export the members from a Big Segment into a CSV file:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** list and click the name of the segment you wish to export. The segment's **Targeting** tab appears.
2. Click on the "Target individual users" **overflow menu**.
3. Select "Export as CSV".

The export process runs in the background. When it completes, you receive an email notification containing a link to where you can download your CSV file.

LaunchDarkly does not support exporting segments with more than 10 million users.
