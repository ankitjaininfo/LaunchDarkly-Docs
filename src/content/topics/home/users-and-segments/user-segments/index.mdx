## Overview

This topic explains how to build and manage user segments. User segments let you target groups of users individually or by attribute.

## Understanding user segments

User segments are lists of users that you can use to manage flag targeting behavior in bulk. Segments are useful for keeping groups of users, like `beta-users` or `enterprise-customers`, up to date. They allow you to more quickly turn features on or off for certain groups with confidence.

LaunchDarkly supports two types of segments:

- [Standard segments](/home/users/standard-segments)
- [Big Segments](/home/users/big-segments), including Big Segments synced with Amplitude

### Understanding segment types

There are a few differences between standard segments and Big Segments. You cannot convert a segment from one kind to another after you create it, so choose the kind that best suits your use case when you create it.

This table explains the differences between standard segments and Big Segments:

### Targeting with segments

There are some differences between flag targeting and segment targeting:

- Segments are environment-specific. They do not populate in environments other than the one you created them in.
- Segment targeting can reference another segment only if both segments exist in the same environment, and if you're using a version of an SDK that supports contexts. To learn more, read [SDKs](/sdk). 

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>Not all SDKs support targeting segments within segments</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

To target a segment within another segment, you must be using the latest version of an SDK that supports the feature. To find out which versions of which SDKs support this feature, read the [list of SDKs that support contexts](/sdk).

If you target a segment within another segment but aren't using an updated SDK, the flag will skip the segment targeting rule and evaluate contexts against the next subsequent rule.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Like flags, you cannot create a circular reference between two segments, for example, where segment A targets segment B and segment B targets segment A.

## Using the Segments list

You can view standard and Big Segments on the **Segments** list.

From the list, you can filter segments to display only those synced from Amplitude.

## Creating user segments

To create a new segment:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** list.
2. Click **Create segment**. The "Create a segment" panel appears.

![The "Segments" list with the "Create segment" button called out.](segments-new-callout.png)


3. Give your segment a human-readable **Name**.
4. Enter a **Key** for the segment. This field auto-populates based on the segment name, but you can change it if you need to.
5. (Optional) Add a **Description**.
6. (Optional) Choose **Tags** from the menu.
7. Select the **Standard** option to create a standard segment, or the **Big** option to create a Big Segment. You cannot convert a segment from one kind to another after you create it.

8. Click **Save segment**. The segment's **Targeting** tab appears.

You can further edit the segment's settings from its **Settings** tab.

## Converting a rule into a standard segment

You can convert a targeting rule into a standard segment from the flag's **Targeting** page.

Here is an image of the "Convert individual user targets to segment" dialog:

To convert a rule to a standard segment:

1. Navigate to the flag's **Targeting** page.
2. In the user targeting section or the rule matching section, click the **overflow menu** of the rule you wish to convert. The overflow menu appears.
3. Click "Convert to segment". The "Convert to segment" window appears:

![A flag rule, with the "Convert to segment" option called out.](segment-convert-to-segment-users.png)

4. Give your segment a human-readable **Name**.
5. (Optional) Add a **Description**.
6. (Optional) Choose any **Tags** from the menu menu.
7. Click **Save segment**. A confirmation appears indicating that you've created a new segment.

After you click "Convert to segment", targeted users are cleared. A new segment rule targeting the newly created segment `test-12345` appears at the top of the list of targeting rules.

Here is an image of the targeting section:

## Deleting segments

To delete a segment, find the segment you want to delete on the **Segments** list and click **Delete**.
