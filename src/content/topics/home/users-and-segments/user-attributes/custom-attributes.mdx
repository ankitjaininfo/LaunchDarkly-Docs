## Overview

This topic explains what custom user attributes are and how to configure them.

LaunchDarkly allows you to target users based on arbitrary custom attributes, which means you can control who receives features based on any criteria that you send to us. To learn more, read [Targeting rules](/home/flags/targeting-rules).

## Creating custom user attributes

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>First create custom attributes in your SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must first create custom attributes within your SDK before you can use them in targeting rules. To learn how, read [User configuration](/sdk/features/user-config).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can create custom attributes by configuring user objects within your SDK. If you create a custom attribute on the <strong>Users</strong> list, you can add the attribute to flag targeting rules, but flag evaluations won't be able to use the attribute until you configure it within your SDK. To learn how, read [User configuration](/sdk/features/user-config).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Custom and built-in attributes cannot share keys</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you create a custom attribute with a key already in use by a built-in attribute, the SDK will behave unpredictably during feature flag evaluation. For a list of built-in attributes and their keys, read [Built-in user attributes](/home/users/built-in-attributes).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Custom attributes are environment-specific. They are not shared between environments or projects.

Here is an example user object which contains custom user attributes:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'User object with custom attributes', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
{
"key":"YOUR-USER-KEY",
"firstName": "Bob",
"custom":{
	"groups":[
		"COMPANY-GROUP-1",
		"COMPANY-GROUP-2"
		]
	}
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

There is no limit to the number of custom attributes. However, adding custom attributes does increase the size of the user object. JavaScript-based client-side SDKs send the user object during initialization, so a large number of custom attributes may mean it takes longer for the SDK to finish initializing. To learn more, read [Initializing the client](/sdk/client-side/javascript#initializing-the-client).

## Setting custom user attribute values

The value of a custom attribute can be of the following types:

* boolean
* number
* string
* array

You should not set the value of a custom attribute to a JSON object. If you do, it won't appear on the **Users** list.
