## Overview

This topic explains how to create a metric to use within an experiment in LaunchDarkly.

Metrics measure audience behaviors affected by the flags in your experiments. You can use metrics to track all kinds of things, from how often customers access a URL to how long that URL takes to load a page. Create metrics that align with your business goals and connect them to your team's flags to track the impact of different flag variations over time.

## Understanding types of metrics

Conversion metrics register events when an end user takes an action based on a feature flag they encounter. Conversion metrics can track `click`, `page view`, and `custom` event kinds. Numeric metrics measure numeric values against a baseline you set. Numeric metrics can track the `custom` event kind. To learn more about event kinds, read [Analytics events](/sdk/concepts/events).

There are four metric options in LaunchDarkly:

- [Click conversion metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics/click)
- [Custom conversion metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics/custom-conversion)
- [Custom numeric metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics/custom-numeric)
- [Page view conversion metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics/page-view)

The following table explains the kinds of events you can track with a metric and their SDK compatibility:

### Choosing a metric

You should choose a metric type that correctly measures the effect of a change on your customers or codebase. If you are unsure of what metric type to use, it may be helpful to begin by determining what kind of data you are trying to measure.

When you create a metric, you will map the new metric to a context kind you have marked as available for experiments:

This table includes examples of different kinds of data you can measure with different metric types, and common randomization unit context kind mappings:

    <TableRow>

      <TableCell>
        <code>user</code><br />
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

## Connecting a metric to an experiment

After you create a metric, you can use it in one or more experiments. The randomization unit you map the metric to must match the context kind you want to randomize on.

In this example, the experiment has a randomization unit of `customer`. It is compatible with the chosen metric, because the metric can measure events from `customer` context kinds.

## Deleting metrics

You should delete a metric only when you are sure you will no longer use it in any experiments.

To delete a metric:

1. Navigate to the **Experiments** list.
2. Click the **Metrics** tab.
3. Click the title of the metric you want to delete. The "Edit metric" panel appears.
4. Click **Delete this metric**.

This metric is now deleted permanently across all environments in the project.
