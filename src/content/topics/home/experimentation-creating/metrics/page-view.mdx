## Overview

This topic explains how to create a page view conversion metric for an experiment in LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Some metrics require the JavaScript or React SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Page view conversion metrics are only available on the JavaScript and React SDKs. If you do not use the JavaScript or React SDK and would like to track clicks or page views, use a custom conversion metric.

</Callout>

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>Call track and flush when an end user is redirected</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

SDKs send events at regular intervals, such as every five seconds. If a browser redirects an end user to another page, any events that occurred between when the SDK last sent events and when browser redirected the end user will be lost. To avoid this, call track and then flush when you know the browser will redirect an end user to another page, such as on click.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Page view conversion metrics track how often end users view an element on a page hosted at a specific URL. Page view conversion metrics must be used with either the JavaScript or React SDK.

For example, you might want to track how often customers view an item when its price is discounted different amounts.

## Creating page view conversion metrics

To create a page view conversion metric:

1. Follow steps 1-7 in [Creating click conversion metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics/click#creating-click-conversion-metrics) until you have configured the form up to the "Event information" section.
2. Click the **Event kind** menu and select "Page view":

3. Specify the type of **Target URL** you want to track behavior on. To learn about the different options for URL matching, read the table in [Creating click conversion metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics/click#creating-click-conversion-metrics).
4. (Optional) Click **Add additional URL** to track behavior on more than one URL.
5. Choose one or more context kinds available for experiments for the metric to measure events from.

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>Metrics must use valid randomization units</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When creating a new metric, we recommend consulting with an Experimentation expert in your organization or with LaunchDarkly Support to be sure your context kind selection is valid. To learn more, read [Randomization units](/home/creating-experiments/allocation#randomization-units).

6. Click **Save metric**.

After you create a metric, you can connect it to an experiment. To learn how, read [Building experiments](/home/creating-experiments#building-experiments).
