## Overview

This topic explains how to configure your existing [Segment](https://segment.com/) account to send events to LaunchDarkly experiments.

This lets you use Segment events as custom metric events in LaunchDarkly experiments, so you can measure results immediately, without any instrumentation, code, or delays.

After you connect LaunchDarkly and Segment, you can use the name of the existing Segment event when you create a custom metric to include it in your experiment immediately.

If you want to use metric events from another source, consider using our [metric import API](/home/creating-experiments/import-metric-events).

## Setting up the Segment Experimentation integration

To set up the integration, you must have access to your Segment and LaunchDarkly accounts. You will need them both to connect them to each other.

### Copying your LaunchDarkly client-side ID

To copy your LaunchDarkly client-side ID:

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click the **Projects** tab.
3. Click the name of the project you would like to receive events from Segment from. The **Environments** tab appears.
4. Click the environment's client-side ID to copy it to your clipboard.

### Connecting Segment to LaunchDarkly

To connect Segment to LaunchDarkly:

1. Navigate to the Segment app's **Destinations** page.
2. Click **Add Destination**.
3. Find [LaunchDarkly (Actions)](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-launchdarkly/) in the Destination Catalog.

4. Click **Configure LaunchDarkly (Actions)**.
5. Choose which Segment **Source** should send data to the LaunchDarkly destination.
6. Click **Next**.
7. Fill in the **Destination name** field with the name of your choice.
8. Click **Save**.
9. Paste the client-side ID from the previous procedure into the **LaunchDarkly client-side ID** field.
10. Click **Save Changes**.
11. Click the **Enable Destination** radio button.
12. Click **Save Changes**.

13. Navigate to the **Mappings** tab.
14. Click **New Mapping**.
15. Click **Track Event**.
16. The **Edit: Track Event** page guides you through the process of mapping [Segment Track events](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) to LaunchDarkly experimentation events. The default settings should be acceptable for most customers.
17. Click **Save**.
18. On the **Mappings** tab, click the radio buttons associated with the **Track Event** mapping to begin sending events to LaunchDarkly.

## How the integration works

After you connect Segment and LaunchDarkly, events from the source you choose can appear as custom metric events in LaunchDarkly experiments. This process fails if LaunchDarkly fails to recognize events Segment sends to it as Experimentation events.

LaunchDarkly correlates the metric events sent from Segment with LaunchDarkly context keys. This correlation uses the Segment user ID, if it is present. Otherwise, the correlation uses the Segment anonymous ID.

To register events from Segment in a LaunchDarkly experiment, you must meet the following criteria:

- The name of the Segment event is identical to the name of the custom metric in your LaunchDarkly experiment. When the Segment event and LaunchDarkly metric have identical names, events from Segment will appear as events in the LaunchDarkly experiment with which the metric is associated.
- The LaunchDarkly metric must be attached to a flag and the experiment must be recording. To learn how to create metrics in LaunchDarkly, read [Creating metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics).

You can associate the track event as a `custom` event at the time you set up a new metric. To learn more about track events, read [Segment's documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/).
