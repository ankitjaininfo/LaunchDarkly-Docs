## Overview

This topic introduces the concept of account members in LaunchDarkly and shows you how to use the **Members** list.

LaunchDarkly supports user object management with OAuth, SAML, and SCIM. To learn more, read [Enabling single sign-on](/home/account-security/sso).

## Understanding members in LaunchDarkly

Account members are people who work at your organization or have access rights to your organization's LaunchDarkly environment for another reason, such as contractors or part-time employees.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly account members are not LaunchDarkly users</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly users are resources, including people, who encounter feature flags in your app. In many cases, they are customers or people accessing your product. To learn more about users, read [The Users list](/home/users/users-list).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Use the **Members** tab in the **Account settings** page to invite new account members to LaunchDarkly, remove old account members, or manage access controls for account members by setting roles.

You can search for a specific member using the search bar. You can also filter members by **Team**, **Role**, or **Last seen** using the filters at the top of the "Members" list:

![The "Members" tab with filters applied.](settings-members-filters.png)

In addition to filtering, you can also sort by the "Name" and "Last seen" columns. The "Last seen" column displays how long it has been since members logged in to your LaunchDarkly account.

Possible "Last seen" statuses include:

- N minutes/hours/days/months/years ago: The amount of time since a member last logged in. If a member logged in using the API, the status also displays the name of the personal access token they used.
- Never: The member has never logged in.

To learn more about teams in LaunchDarkly, read [Teams](/home/teams). To learn more about roles, read [Understanding member roles](/home/members/managing#understanding-member-roles).

## Adding members to LaunchDarkly

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>This is an Admin-only feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The **Members** list is only accessible if you're a LaunchDarkly Admin. To learn more, read [Understanding member roles](/home/members/managing#understanding-member-roles).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Use the **Members** tab to access a list of all the members in your organization with LaunchDarkly access.

From there, you can invite new account members to LaunchDarkly, remove old account members, or manage access controls for account members by setting roles. To modify an existing member's information, click their name.

To add new members:

1. Navigate to the [**Account Settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings) page.
2. Click the [**Members**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/members) tab.
3. Click **Invite members**:

6. (Optional) Select teams to add these members to.
   ![The "Invite members" dialog with the "Teams" menu open.](invite-members-teams.png)
7. Click **Invite members**.

New members now receive an email inviting them to your LaunchDarkly account. You can resend the invitation or manage a member's roles and team membership by clicking on the member's name in the Members list.

You can also allow members of your organization to find and join your LaunchDarkly account more easily with options in Organization access settings. To learn more read, [Organization access settings](/home/account-security/organization-access-settings).

## Exporting a list of account members

You can export a list of your account members, including their IDs, email addresses, first and last names, built-in roles, and custom roles, to a CSV file.

Here's how:

1. Navigate to the [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings) page.
2. Click the **Members** tab.
3. (Optional) Filter by **Team**, **Role**, or **Last seen** if you want to export a subset of your account members.
4. Click **Export CSV**. A CSV file of account members downloads to your machine.

## Understanding member roles

You can assign different roles to LaunchDarkly account members. There are four different built-in roles in LaunchDarkly: Reader, Writer, Admin, and Owner. To learn more about these roles, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](/home/members/built-in-roles).

In addition to a built-in role, you can give account members custom roles to more tightly define the actions they can and can't take in your LaunchDarkly account. To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

To learn more about how custom roles and built-in roles work, read [Managing your account members](/home/members).

## Enabling multi-factor authentication

For additional security, you can require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your account. When MFA is enabled, account members won't be able to log in to LaunchDarkly without verifying their identity with a second method.

We strongly recommend that all LaunchDarkly members enable MFA for their individual accounts, and that administrators enforce MFA for their entire organization. In the event of a credential leak or device theft, MFA can prevent malicious third parties from accessing a LaunchDarkly account they should not be able to access.

To learn more, read [Multi-factor authentication](/home/account-security/mfa).

## Inviting members with other accounts

When you invite a member to LaunchDarkly, you may get an error message that says the email address is already in use. This can happen when a person already has a trial account with LaunchDarkly or is a member of another LaunchDarkly account associated with that email address.

To fix this, ask the person you want to invite to change the email address associated with their other account or delete their other account, following the instructions in [How to join an organization when you already have a LaunchDarkly account](/home/getting-started/your-account#how-to-join-an-organization-when-you-already-have-a-launchdarkly-account). After they change the email address or delete their other account, invite them to your LaunchDarkly organization again.

You can also tell people in your organization to delete their other accounts before you roll out LaunchDarkly organization-wide.

## Using aliased email addresses in LaunchDarkly

Alternatively, if the member has a Google Apps or Outlook 365 account, you can invite them to LaunchDarkly using an alias. An alias account is the email address of the person you wish to invite with a plus sign (`+`) and additional text string appended. `joe+launchdarkly@example.com` is an alias of `joe@example.com`.

For example, if the user object `alice@diner.com` already exists in LaunchDarkly, you can also invite `alice+newproject@diner.com` to your LaunchDarkly organization. Emails from both addresses are sent to `alice@diner.com`, but only `alice+newproject@diner.com` has access to your LaunchDarkly organization. This is also helpful when you need contractors to collaborate with you on projects.

## Removing members from LaunchDarkly

To remove a member from your account:

1. Navigate to the [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings) page.
2. Click the [**Members**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/members) tab.
3. Find the member in the list of account members.
4. Click the member's name.
5. Navigate to the **Settings** tab for that member.
6. Click **Delete member**.
