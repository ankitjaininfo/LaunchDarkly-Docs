## Overview

This topic describes interactive tutorials and demos that are available from within LaunchDarkly's learning center.

Here are some of the things you can do in the learning center:

- Use the "Get started" section to create your first flag, watch a video about LaunchDarkly, [try an interactive demo](#using-the-interactive-demo), learn about Slack integrations, [connect an SDK](#connecting-an-sdk), or invite new members
- Explore Enterprise features
- Learn about what's new in LaunchDarkly

To open the learning center, click on the **question mark** icon in the top toolbar:

## Connecting an SDK

You can use the "Connect an SDK" tutorial to connect LaunchDarkly to your application.

Here's how:

1. Click on the **question mark** icon in the top toolbar. The learning center opens.
2. Click **Get started**.

3. Click **Connect an SDK** in the "Quick links" section:

4. Follow the steps to select an SDK, connect to a flag, and test your application. Your application displays a message indicating the current value of your flag.

### Troubleshooting your SDK connection

The tutorial is complete when LaunchDarkly starts receiving analytics events from your application. In some cases, LaunchDarkly does not receive events immediately, and displays an error message instead.

If you are having trouble with your SDK connection, here are some actions you can try:

* **Ensure you have a reliable network connection for first-time initialization.** The SDK will time out if it cannot get a network connection to LaunchDarkly. If this happens, it will serve the flag values defined in your application code until it can connect to LaunchDarkly.
* **Double-check your SDK key.** The example file provided within the tutorial automatically includes the correct SDK key. You can confirm the current value of your SDK key on the **Account settings** page under the **Environments** tab for your project. Alternatively, you can open the search bar and copy the SDK key for the current environment. To open the search bar, click on the magnifying glass icon or use `CMD+K` (Mac) or `CTRL+K` (PC).
* **Confirm that you copied the entirety of the sample code to create your application.** If you have modified the sample code, refer to the appropriate SDK documentation. To learn more, visit the  [LaunchDarkly SDK repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-sdk+org%3Alaunchdarkly&type=Repositories).

## Using the interactive demo

You can use the interactive demo to play with feature flags in an existing application. This is a good option if you want to experience how feature flags work without having to create your own application.

As part of the demo, LaunchDarkly automatically creates a new project called "LaunchDarkly demo application" in your account. The project includes two environments and the feature flags that the demo uses.

Here's how to use the interactive demo:

1. Click on the **question mark** icon in the top toolbar. The learning center opens.
2. Click **Get started**.
3. Click **Try an interactive demo**:

4. A new browser tab appears and describes the demo scenario: you're a game developer working on a game called "Toggle Runner."
5. Follow the instructions in the demo to release the game and enable different difficulty modes. The demo creates a new project and environment in your account, so you can review the setup as often as you like.

## Additional resources

If you have completed the options from the "Get started" panel within LaunchDarkly and would like to continue exploring, additional content is available. To learn more, read [Additional resources](/guides/additional-resources).
