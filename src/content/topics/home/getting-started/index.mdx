## Using feature management

Feature management is a framework for feature flag-driven development, testing, and experimentation. The basic unit of feature management is a feature flag.

To start using feature management, first create a feature flag in LaunchDarkly. A feature flag describes rules for who can access a feature in your app, whether that means individual users, users who share common characteristics like email domain or type of mobile device, or just a certain percentage of your application's traffic.

Next, you need to connect your application to LaunchDarkly. You can connect to LaunchDarkly using any of our 20+ SDKs.

Then, in your application, use the SDK to make a function call any time you want to determine whether a particular user should receive a feature, and what variation of the feature they should receive. The SDKs use local caching to make these variation checks as efficient as possible.

The SDKs send analytics events to LaunchDarkly to record every user who encounters a flag and which variation they received. You control which data is sent to LaunchDarkly and can designate certain data as private if you want LaunchDarkly to use it for flag evaluation but not store it.

To begin, read [Joining an account](#joining-an-account), then skip to the [Getting started](#getting-started-in-different-roles) section below that best describes your role.

## Getting started in different roles

### Getting started as a software developer

<Details summary="Expand Getting started as a software developer">

As a software developer, you're responsible for creating and implementing feature flags in code. You can use feature flags in any aspect of your application, from the customer-facing user interface (UI) to the backend.

First, you must set up a LaunchDarkly SDK to integrate LaunchDarkly with your code. To learn more, read [Setting up an SDK](/home/getting-started/setting-up). For information about how to choose an SDK, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side). After you've set up a LaunchDarkly SDK, you can [create your first feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags).

For a guided example of these steps, try the in-app [tutorial](https://app.launchdarkly.com/get-started/connect-an-sdk).

Once you have a basic understanding of flags, you can work with others in your organization to determine how you want to target flag variations to users or segments. To learn more, read [Targeting users with flags](/home/flags/targeting-users).

As you add more flags, you can start organizing your flags across different environments. To learn more, read [Organizing your flags](/home/organize). This is also a good time to start thinking about managing the lifecycle of each flag. To learn more, read [Flags in your codebase](/home/code). You can also explore our integrations to help you make LaunchDarkly a seamless part of your workflow. Integrations let you configure the product, receive LaunchDarkly events, or use triggers to perform actions on feature flags from third-party tools. To learn more, read [Integrations](/integrations).

As a software developer, you may also be responsible for other engineering work related to feature management, including automatically toggling feature flags, building custom integrations, or exporting data to destinations outside of LaunchDarkly. You can perform these and other operations using the LaunchDarkly REST API. To learn more, read the tutorial [Using the LaunchDarkly REST API](/guides/api/rest-api). For complete reference materials, read the [API documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/).

### Getting started as a product manager

<Details summary="Expand Getting started as a product manager">

As a product manager or rollout manager, you are likely responsible for coordinating deployments and feature releases.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Try an interactive demo</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you haven't worked directly with feature flags before, LaunchDarkly has an example application you can play with. In the learning center, navigate to the "Get started" panel and select "Try an interactive demo."

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

First, learn how to [turn feature flags on and off](/home/getting-started/toggle). Then, start thinking about how you'd like to [target flag variations to users or segments](/home/flags).

As a product manager, you may also build and monitor experiments to understand the impact of features you roll out. Each experiment is a set of actions used to test a hypothesis. You can use feature flags to send flag variations to portions of your user base, and compare your users' different reactions. You can use this for A/B/n testing, acceptance testing, and stress testing. To learn more, read [About Experimentation](/home/about-experimentation).

### Getting started as a systems architect

<Details summary="Expand Getting started as a systems architect">

As a systems architect, you're responsible for designing services and processes for your organization's engineering team.

Now that your engineering team is using LaunchDarkly, you can make LaunchDarkly a seamless part of your workflow. Integrations let you configure the product, receive LaunchDarkly events, or use triggers to perform actions on feature flags from third-party tools. For example, LaunchDarkly integrates with various application performance management (APM) tools, with collaboration tools like Slack, with IDE connectors, with workflow management tools, and with several other productivity and management applications. To learn more, read [Integrations](/integrations).

To learn about common problems integrations can help solve, read [Integrations use cases](/guides/integrations/integrations-use-cases). For best practices to help you succeed with LaunchDarkly on specific platforms, read our [platform-specific guides](/guides/sdk).

### Getting started as an account administrator

<Details summary="Expand Getting started as an account administrator">

As an account administrator, you are likely responsible for managing account members, monitoring billing and usage, and facilitating any integrations.

First, learn about how to [set up and manage account members](/home/members). Each member can have one of several built-in roles within LaunchDarkly, including Reader, Writer, or Admin. To learn more, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](/home/members/built-in-roles). If you would like to set up more precise access control, you can configure custom roles for your members. To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

Next, make sure you understand the options for securing your account, including how to precisely manage which account members can perform certain actions and how to enable multi-factor authentication and single sign-on in your LaunchDarkly account. To learn more, read [Securing your account](/home/account-security).

If you are in a larger organization, you may also think about grouping your account members into [teams](/home/teams). Teams allow you to control permissions for groups of account members, rather than for individuals. Additionally, teams allow you to map permissions in LaunchDarkly to your organizational structure. For example, you can give mobile flag permissions to the mobile team and desktop flag permissions to the desktop team.

Once your account is set up and your organization has started using feature flags, you can use LaunchDarkly's data visualization tools to [understand your monthly billing metrics](/home/billing).
