## Overview

This topic explains how to join LaunchDarkly as a new account member.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly is for groups and organizations</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You cannot sign up for LaunchDarkly as a user who is not associated with an organization's account. Instead, an administrator or account owner from your organization must send you an invitation email. If you want to sign up for LaunchDarkly as an individual, you can sign up for a [free 14-day trial](https://launchdarkly.com/start-trial/).

</CalloutDescription>

## Join your organization's existing account

You can join your organization's LaunchDarkly account in one of two ways:

- An admin can invite you to your organization's account
- You can request access if your organization has enabled domain matching

### Joining through an Admin invite 

When an Admin invites you to your organization's LaunchDarkly account, you will receive an email from LaunchDarkly. Follow the instructions in the email to create your account and join your organization.

### Joining through domain matching

To request access through domain matching:

1. Navigate to the [Signup page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/signup).
2. Complete and submit the signup form. LaunchDarkly sends a verification email to the email address you provided.
3. Click the verification link.
4. If your organization has domain matching enabled, a list of organizations to which you can request access appears.
5. Select an organization from the list and click "Request access."

If your organization does not have domain matching enabled, completing the signup form in step 1 will create a new account with a 14-day trial. To learn more, read [Enabling domain matching](/home/account-security/organization-access-settings#enabling-domain-matching).

## How to join an organization when you already have a LaunchDarkly account

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>Invitations fail when an email address is in use by another account</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If your email address is associated with a trial or other organization's account, you must de-associate it before you can receive an invitation email from your organization.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

A LaunchDarkly account can only have one email address associated with it, and one email address cannot be used for multiple LaunchDarkly accounts. If you used your preferred email address to sign up for a trial, for example, you must de-associate it from the trial account before you can join your organization's LaunchDarkly account, using one of two methods:

- Changing your account email address
- Deleting your other account if you are the Owner

### Changing your account email address

To change the email address associated with an account:

1. Log in to your existing LaunchDarkly account.
2. Navigate to the **Account settings** page and click into the **Profile** tab.
3. Replace your original email address in the **Email address** field with a new email address.
4. Click **Update my info**. A re-authentication screen appears.
5. Enter your original login email address and password. You are returned to your **Profile** tab.
6. Click **Update my info** again. Your email address is now updated.

You can now accept an invitation from your organization owner using the email address previously associated with the other account.

Here is a screenshot of the Profile tab under Account settings:

### Deleting your other account

To delete an account:

1. Log in to your existing LaunchDarkly account.
2. Navigate to the **Account settings** page and click into the **Members** tab.
3. Scroll to the "Delete account" section.
4. Click **Delete account**.
5. When prompted, enter your LaunchDarkly login credentials.
6. Click **Delete account** again. A confirmation dialog appears.
7. Type `yes` in the dialog to confirm.

You can now accept an invitation from your organization owner using the email address previously associated with the other account.

## Inviting other members to LaunchDarkly

To learn how to invite other members to LaunchDarkly as an Admin, read [Adding members to LaunchDarkly](/home/members/managing#adding-members-to-launchdarkly).

## Understanding LaunchDarkly's user entity types

In LaunchDarkly, it is important to distinguish between **account members** and **users**. Here is a table explaining the difference:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Title</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Definition</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>"Account members," or "members"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        These are people who have been invited to join a LaunchDarkly account to create and manage feature flags. They can log into a company's LaunchDarkly account and view the flags list. They may be employees of a company that uses LaunchDarkly, people with an @your-company.com email address, or people or entities associated with your identity provider (IdP).
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>"Users"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        These are people or entities who trigger flag evaluations. This can cause them to appear in the <strong>Users</strong> list in LaunchDarkly, but they cannot log into the organization's LaunchDarkly account or view or modify their own or other user's data. They may be customers of a company using LaunchDarkly, consumers of an app or website that uses feature flags, or other entities that can cause flag evaluations to occur.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>
