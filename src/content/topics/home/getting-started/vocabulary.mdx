## Overview

This topic defines common words used in the LaunchDarkly application and documentation. While many of these words may be familiar to you, in some cases they have nuances specific to LaunchDarkly.

The following definitions may be useful as you work in LaunchDarkly:

## A

### Audience

An [experiment's](#experiment) `audience` is the combination of the targeting rule you're experimenting on and the number of [contexts](#context) you [allocate](#traffic-allocation) to each flag [variation](#variation).

To learn more, read [Allocating experiment audiences](/home/creating-experiments/allocation).

### Attribute

An `attribute` is a field in a [context](#context) that you can use in targeting rules for flags and segments. Each context that encounters a feature flag in your product can have a different value for a given attribute.

To learn more, read [Context attributes](/home/contexts/attributes).

## C

### Context

A `context` is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product.

To learn more, read [Contexts and segments](/home/contexts).

### Context kind

A `context kind` organizes your [contexts](#context) into different types based on the kinds of resources encountering flags. Each context has one `kind` with a unique set of corresponding attributes that you can use for targeting and Experimentation.

To learn more, read [Contexts and context kinds](/home/contexts#contexts-and-context-kinds).

### Context instance

A `context instance` is a unique combination of one or more contexts that have encountered a feature flag in your product.

To learn more, read [Context instances](/home/contexts/multi-contexts#context-instances).

## D

### Default rule

A `default rule` describes the feature flag [variation](#variation) to serve to the contexts that don't match any of the individual targets or rules you have previously specified for the flag. It is sometimes called the "fallthrough" rule because all of the rules preceding it have been evaluated, and the context encountering the flag has "fallen through" to this last rule. To learn more, read [Setting the default rule](/home/flags/targeting-rules#setting-the-default-rule).

The default rule only applies when the flag is toggled on. If the flag is toggled off, then LaunchDarkly will serve the "default off variation" for the flag. In the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI), the default off variation is specified in the field labeled "If targeting is off, serve." To learn more, read [Setting the default off variation](/home/flags/targeting-rules#setting-the-default-off-variation).

## E

### Environment

An `environment` is an organizational unit contained within a [project](#project). You can create multiple environments within each project. Environments in LaunchDarkly typically correspond to the environments in which your code is deployed, such as development, staging, and production. All environments in a single project contain the same [flags](#flag). However, the flags can have different states, targets, and rules in each environment.

To learn more, read [Environments](/home/organize/environments).

### Evaluation

An `evaluation` is what happens when your application's code sends the [LaunchDarkly SDK](#sdk) information about a particular [flag](#flag) and a particular [context](#context) that has encountered that flag, and the SDK sends back the value of the [flag variation](#variation) that the context should receive. We say that the SDK evaluates the flag, or that the flag has been evaluated for a particular context or customer.

To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating).

### Experiment

An `experiment` is a LaunchDarkly feature that connects a [flag](#flag) with a [metric](#metric) to measure end-user behavior. Experiments track how different [variations](#variation) of a flag affect end-user interactions with your app, and determine the [winning variation](#winning-variation). You can run an experiment for one or more [iterations](#iteration).

To learn more, read [About Experimentation](/home/about-experimentation).

## F

### Fallback value

The `fallback value` is the flag [variation](#variation) that LaunchDarkly serves in the following two situations:

* If your application cannot connect to LaunchDarkly.
* If your application can connect to LaunchDarkly, but the flag is toggled off and you have not specified a default off variation. To learn more, read [Setting the default off variation](/home/flags/targeting-rules#setting-the-default-off-variation).

Regardless of how you configure targeting for your feature flag, each time you evaluate a flag from the SDK, you must include a fallback value as one of the parameters. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating).

### Fallthrough rule

A `fallthrough rule` is a synonym for [default rule](#default-rule).

### Flag

A `flag` is the basic unit of feature management. It describes the different variations of a feature and the rules that allow different entities to access them. Different entities that access your features could be a percentage of your application's traffic, individuals, or people or software entities who share common characteristics like location, email domain, or type of mobile device. The entities that encounter feature flags in your product are called [contexts](#context).

To learn more, read [Using feature management](/home/getting-started#using-feature-management).

## I

### Iteration

An `iteration` is a defined time period that you run an [experiment](#experiment) for. An iteration can be any length that you choose, and you can run multiple iterations of the same experiment.

To learn more, read [Managing experiments](/home/analyzing-experiments/managing).

## M

### Member

A `member` or `account member` is a person who uses LaunchDarkly at your organization. These people work at your organization or have access rights to your organization's LaunchDarkly environment for another reason, such as contractors or part-time employees.

To learn more, read [LaunchDarkly account members](/home/members/managing).

### Metric

A `metric` is a tool that allows you to measure specific end-user behaviors as part of an [experiment](#experiment). Metrics can measure things like links clicked, money spent, or response time. When combined with a [flag](#flag) in an experiment, metrics determine which flag [variation](#variation) is the [winning variation](#winning-variation).

To learn more, read [Creating metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics).

## P

### Percentage rollout

A `percentage rollout` is a targeting [rule](#rule) that serves a given flag [variation](#variation) to a specified percentage of contexts that encounter the flag. A common use case for percentage rollouts is to increment the percentage of customers targeted by a flag over time until 100% of the customers receive one variation of a flag.

To learn more, read [Percentage rollouts](/home/flags/rollouts).

### Prerequisite

You can make flags depend on other flags being enabled to take effect. A `prerequisite` flag is one on which a second flag depends. When the second flag is evaluated, the prerequisite flag must be on, and the [target](#target) must be receiving the variation of the prerequisite flag that you specify. If the prerequisite flag is toggled off, the target will receive the default off variation of the dependent flag.

To learn more, read [Flag prerequisites](/home/flags/prerequisites/).

### Project

A `project` is an organizational unit for flags in your LaunchDarkly account. You can define projects in any way you like. A common pattern is to create one project in your LaunchDarkly account for each product your company makes. Each project can have multiple environments.

To learn more, read [Projects](/home/organize/projects).

## R

### Randomization unit

An [experiment's](#experiment) `randomization unit` is the [context kind](#context-kind) that the experiment uses to randomly sort [contexts](#context) into each [variation](#variation) by, according to the experiment's [traffic allocation](#traffic-allocation).

To learn more, read [Randomization units](/home/creating-experiments/allocation#randomization-units).

### Role, custom role

A `role` is a description of the access that a member has to information within LaunchDarkly. Every LaunchDarkly account has four built-in roles: Reader, Writer, Admin, and Owner.

A `custom role` is also a description of the access that a member has to information within LaunchDarkly. With custom roles, you create the description of the access using a set of statements called a policy.

Every member must have at least one role or custom role assigned to them, either directly or through a team. This is true even if the role explicitly prohibits them from accessing any information within LaunchDarkly.

To learn more, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](/home/members/built-in-roles), [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles), and [Custom role concepts](/home/members/role-concepts).

### Rule

A `rule` or `targeting rule` is a description of which flag variations your application should serve to which contexts.

Targeting rules can have one or more conditions. Each condition has three parts:

* A context kind and attribute, which defines the scope of the condition's impact, such as only targeting an email address for the selected context kind.
* An operator, which sets differentiating characteristics of the attribute, such as limiting the condition to emails that end with certain extensions.
* A value, which identifies the attribute by a value you specify, such as `.edu`.

To learn more, read [Targeting rules](/home/flags/targeting-rules).

## S

### SDK

The `LaunchDarkly SDK` is the software development kit that you use to integrate LaunchDarkly with your application's code.

We provide more than two dozen LaunchDarkly SDKs, in different languages and frameworks. Our `client-side SDKs` are designed for single-user desktop, mobile, and embedded applications. They are intended to be used in a potentially less secure environment, such as a personal computer or mobile device. Our `server-side SDKs` are designed for multi-user systems. They are intended to be used in a trusted environment, such as inside a corporate network or on a web server.

When your application starts, your code should initialize the LaunchDarkly SDK you're working with. When a customer encounters a feature flag in your application, your code should use the SDK to evaluate the feature flag and retrieve the appropriate flag variation for that customer.

To learn more, read [Setting up an SDK](/home/getting-started/setting-up) and [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side). For more information about the differences between the LaunchDarkly SDK and the LaunchDarkly REST API, read [Comparing LaunchDarkly's SDKs and REST API](/guide/api/comparing-sdk-rest-api).

### Segment

A `segment` is a list of contexts that you can use to manage flag [targeting](#target) behavior in bulk. Segments are useful for keeping groups of contexts, like `beta-users` or `enterprise-customers`, up to date. They are [environment-specific](#environment).

LaunchDarkly supports two types of segments. A standard segment supports up to 15,000 contexts. A Big Segment supports more, and can be backed by an external data store, such as an Amplitude cohort.

To learn more, read [Segments](/home/contexts/segments).

Segment is also the name of a third-party software application that collects and integrates customer data across tools. You can use Segment as a destination for LaunchDarkly's Data Export feature. To learn more, read [Segment](/home/data-export/segment).

## T

### Target

To `target` (verb), is to specify that LaunchDarkly should serve certain flag [variations](#variation) to specific [contexts](#context) that encounter [feature flags](#flag) in your application. A `target` (noun) is an individual context or a set of contexts described by a targeting [rule](#rule).

To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

### Team

A `team` is a group of members in your LaunchDarkly account. To learn more, read [Teams](/home/teams).

### Traffic allocation

An [experiment's](#experiment) `traffic allocation` is the amount of [contexts](#context) you assign to each flag [variation](#variation) you're experimenting on.

To learn more, read [Allocating experiment audiences](/home/creating-experiments/allocation).

## U

### User

Previously, a `user` was the only way to refer to an entity that encountered feature flags in your product.

Newer versions of the LaunchDarkly SDKs replace users with [contexts](#context). Contexts are a more powerful and flexible way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. A user is just one [kind](#context-kind) of context.

People who are logged in to the LaunchDarkly user interface are called [members](#member).

## V

### Variation

A `variation` is a description of a possible value that a flag can have. Each variation must contain the possible flag value. It may also contain a name and description.

Flags share variations across environments within a project. However, the flags can have different states, targets, and rules in each environment.

When you create a flag, you must decide whether it is a boolean flag or a multivariate flag. Boolean flags have exactly two variations, with values of "true" and "false." Multivariate flags can have more than two variations. Each of the variations must have a value of the same type, for example, a string.

To learn more, read [Creating flag variations](/home/flags/variations).

## W

### Winning variation

An [experiment's](#experiment) `winning variation` is the [variation](#variation) that performed the best out of all the variations tested. Every experiment [iteration](#iteration) displays each variation's "probability to be best." The variation with the highest probability to be best is the winning variation.

To learn more, read [Winning variations](/home/analyzing-experiments/winning-variation).
