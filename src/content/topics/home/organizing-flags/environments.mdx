## Overview

This topic explains what environments are in LaunchDarkly and how to use them to manage different business areas or areas of your product lifecycle.

Environments are organizational units contained within projects. Environments allow you to manage your feature flags throughout your entire development lifecycle, from local development through production. Typical environments within a project could be Production, QA, Staging, or individual environments.

Your LaunchDarkly account supports an unlimited number of projects, environments, flags, and server-side monthly context instances (MCI). If you are on a **legacy Starter plan**, your account may be limited to two projects and two environments. To remove those restrictions, [contact Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

You can create multiple environments within each project, and all projects must have at least one environment. To learn more about projects, read [Projects](/home/organize/projects).

You can also use the REST API: [Environments](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Environments)

## Understanding environments

Your first project has two environments, `Test` and `Production`, by default. Each environment has its own SDK key, which is used to connect the LaunchDarkly SDK to a specific environment.

Each feature flag that you create has its own set of targeting rules for each environment. This means that you can change your flag rollout rules in a development or staging environment for QA testing before rolling out to production.

### Opening environments

You can open environments on the **Projects** tab under **Account settings**. Click on a project name to view the environments within the project.

Here is a screenshot of the environments within a project:

![A list of environments within a project.](env-tab.png)

You can also open an environment using the quick search bar.

To open an environment using the quick search bar:

1. Click on the **magnifying glass** icon or `CMD`+`K` (Mac) or `CTRL`+`K` (PC) to open the quick search bar.
2. Select **Open environment**.

![The quick search bar with "Open environment" highlighted.](env-search-bar-open-env.png)

3. Enter an environment's key or SDK key.
4. Click on the environment's name.

You are now viewing the environment you selected.

### Switching environments

The LaunchDarkly sidenav has a menu that shows you the current project and environment and allows you to quickly switch between projects and environments.

Here is a screenshot of the **Switch environment** menu:

![The "Switch environment" menu.](env-switcher.png)

You can also search for and switch between environments using the quick search bar and your environment's key or SDK key. You can find your environment's key and SDK key on the **Environments** tab of your project under **Account settings**.

To switch environments using the quick search bar:

1. Click on the **magnifying glass** icon or `CMD`+`K` (Mac) or `CTRL`+`K` (PC) to open the quick search bar.
2. Select **Switch environment** or hit G, then S.
3. Enter an environment's key or SDK key.
4. Click on the environment's name.

You are now in the environment you selected.

## Creating environments

You can manage your environments from the **Account settings** page. Here, you can add new environments to a project, for example, to give each developer on your team their own environment for local testing.

To add a new environment:

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click the **Projects** tab.
3. Click the name of the project you want to add a new environment to. The **Environments** tab appears.

![The "Projects" tab with the Default Project link called out.](select-project-callout.png)

4. Click **Create environment**. The "Create an environment" panel appears:

![The "Environments" tab on a Project page with the "Create environment" button called out.](create-environment-callout.png)

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Make sure you're in the right project</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Confirm you're creating the environment in the project where you want it to live. You cannot move an environment from one project to another.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

4. Give your environment a human-readable **Name**.
5. (Optional) Give your environment a unique **Key**. This field populates automatically based on your name, but you can change it now if you wish.
6. (Optional) Add **Tags**.
7. (Optional) Select the **Enable secure mode** checkbox to ensure an end user of a client-side SDK cannot impersonate another end user.
8. (Optional) Select the **Require comments for flag and segment changes** checkbox to force members who modify flags and segments to leave a comment to explain their changes.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Comments help establish a change history</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Requiring members to leave comments when they change flags or segments helps your organization understand why flags or segments look and behave certain ways.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Required comments are only enforced from the flags list</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When **Require comments** is enabled, members must leave a comment to explain their changes when they make changes from the flags list in the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI). Comments are not required for changes made with the LaunchDarkly API.

Required comments is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, read [Required comments](/home/feature-workflows/required-comments).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

8. (Optional) Select the **Require confirmation for flag and segment changes** checkbox to force members who modify flags and segments to verify they wish to make these changes.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Confirm changes helps prevent mistakes</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Requiring members to confirm that they wish to make changes may help them from changing the wrong flag or segment inadvertently.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

9. (Optional) Select the **Send detailed events to data export destinations** checkbox to enable Data Export for every flag created in this environment after this checkbox is selected. To learn more, read [Data Export](/home/data-export).
10. (Optional) Specify a **TTL** between 0 and 60 minutes. TTL, or Time to Live, is a setting in DNS records that dictates how long the record should be cached by nameservers and browsers.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Specify a TTL if you use the PHP SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The TTL setting checkbox only applies to environments using the PHP SDK. To learn more, read [TTL settings](#ttl-settings).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

11. (Optional) Choose a **Color** to differentiate this environment from other environments.
12. Click **Create environment**:

  ![The "Create an environment" panel.](env-create.png)

<br /><br />
The new environment appears on the **Account settings** page.

## Cloning environments

For organizations with many flags, cloning an environment is the fastest way to create an environment and copy current flag settings from an existing environment. Cloning an environment also copies segment and flag rules for that environment.

When you clone an environment, the following restrictions apply:
* You cannot clone an environment if it has more than 1000 segments.
* When you clone an environment, context targeting does not carry over to the new environment, because contexts may not exist in both environments.
* Contexts in standard segments, Amplitude synced segments, and Big Segments do not carry over to the new environment. Instead, LaunchDarkly creates an empty segment as a placeholder for flag rules to reference. To learn how to add contexts to these segments, read [Segments](/home/contexts/segments).

Cloning an environment is currently only available through the REST API.

<LearnMore>

You can use the REST API: [Create environment](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Environments#operation/postEnvironment). Use the `source` field in the request body to pass in the environment to clone from.

## Migrating content between environments

You can migrate some, but not all, content between environments from the flags list. To learn more, read [Comparing and copying flag settings between two environments](/home/code/flag-compare-copy#comparing-and-copying-flag-settings-between-two-environments).

Alternatively, customers on a Pro or Enterprise plan can use the REST API to migrate flags from one environment to another. First, GET the feature flag you wish to import, then PATCH to update the flag configuration in production.

To learn more about these endpoints, read [Get feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Feature-flags#operation/getFeatureFlag) and [Update feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Feature-flags#operation/patchFeatureFlag).

## Resetting an environment's key

You can reset an SDK or mobile key for an environment from your **Account settings** page.

To reset an SDK or mobile key:

1. Navigate to the the **Account settings** page.
2. Click the **Projects** tab.
3. Click the name of the project. The **Environments** tab appears.
4. Click the **overflow menu** next to your environment.
5. Select "Edit environment." The "Edit environment" panel appears.
6. In the "Keys" section click **Reset SDK key** or **Reset mobile key**.
7. (Optional) If you are resetting an SDK key, choose how many hours to keep the current SDK key active for, up to 720 hours (30 days). During this period, both the current SDK key and the new SDK key will work. This option is not available for mobile keys.
8. Enter the name or key of your environment:

![The SDK key reset dialog.](env-sdk-key-reset.png)

7. Click **Reset**.

<LearnMore>

You can also use the REST API: [Reset environment SDK key](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Environments#operation/resetEnvironmentSDKKey), [Reset environment mobile SDK key](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Environments#operation/resetEnvironmentMobileKey)

</LearnMore>

## TTL settings

Each environment also has a time-to-live (TTL) setting. This sets the number of minutes that the PHP SDK can cache feature flag rules locally.

The TTL is only used in the PHP SDK, because PHP's shared-nothing architecture makes our streaming model impossible.

For customers using PHP, we recommend setting your TTL to at least five minutes in production environments. This lets the PHP SDK cache feature flag rules for five minutes, so most calls to `variation` will not make a remote request. The tradeoff is that changes you make to your feature flag rules on your flags list will not take effect for five minutes.

If your site has relatively low traffic (fewer than one request per minute), you may wish to increase the TTL to five minutes or more to take better advantage of the local cache.

If the TTL is set to zero minutes, the SDK will not use a local cache, and every call to `variation` will make a remote request to our CDN. You can set your TTL to zero in testing environments so it reflects changes immediately, but we do not recommend a zero minute TTL in production.

In high volume PHP environments, we strongly recommend using our Relay Proxy. To learn more, read [The Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy).

To set the TTL:

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click the **Projects** tab.
3. Click the name of the project. The project page appears.
4. Click the **overflow menu** next to your environment.
5. Select "Edit environment." The "Edit environment" panel appears.
6. Enter a value in the **TTL input** and click **Save environment**.
   ![The "Edit environment" panel with the TTL settings called out.](ttl-settings.png)

## Deleting environments

You can delete an environment when you are no longer using it. Delete with caution, as deleting an environment is permanent.

To delete an environment:

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click the **Projects** tab.
3. Click the name of the project that contains the environment you want to delete.
4. Click the **overflow menu** for the environment.
5. Select **Delete environment**. A "Delete environment?" dialog appears.
6. Enter the name or key of your environment in the confirmation field.
7. Click **Delete**.

Your environment is now deleted.
