## Overview

This topic explains how to use the **Feature flags** list, which shows your feature flags and gives you options to create, modify, and manage them.

## Viewing feature flags

All of your feature flags within a project appear on the flags list. Creating a new flag adds it to the list and all environments within your project, and archiving a feature flag removes it from the list and all environments within your project.

Here is an image of the feature flags list:

To learn how to create a new flag, read [Creating a feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags#creating-a-feature-flag). To learn how to archive a flag, read [Archiving flags](/home/code/flag-archive#archiving-flags).

Use the search bar to find a flag by name, tag, key, or description. You can sort the list of visible flags to identify the oldest or most recent, or to view them in alphabetical order. By default, the most recently created flags appear first.

## Filtering feature flags

You can filter the list of flags to view only flags that share a particular attribute, such as a tag, a status, or an availability to an SDK type.

To filter your flags:

1. Click **Filter**.
2. Choose an attribute from the menu.
3. Choose a value to filter by from the second menu:

4. Click **Add**.

Your flags list now displays only the flags that match the filter you specified.

To add additional attributes to your filter, repeat steps 1-4. The list displays only flags that match all of the attributes you selected.

You can also filter flags by tags. If a flag has a tag applied to it, click the tag to see all other feature flags with that tag applied. The tag's name appears beneath the search bar as a filter option. Click the filter option to add more tags or clear the filter.

To remove a filter, click on the attribute name you want to stop filtering by and click **Clear filter**. To remove multiple filters, click **Clear all**:

## Saving filtered flags lists

You can save your filter configurations as a dashboard to return to later.

To save a dashboard:

1. Apply your desired filters.
2. Click **Save**. The "Save current dashboard" dialog appears.
3. Enter a name for the dashboard:

4. Click **Save dashboard**.

To later load your saved dashboard, expand the **Save** menu and click on the dashboard you want to view:

Your dashboard now displays with the saved filters.

## Following flags

You can follow a flag to receive an email notification, and, if applicable, a notification in the LaunchDarkly Slack app, when someone makes a targeting change to that flag. Notifications are environment-specific, so you must follow a flag in each environment you want notifications for. You can follow a flag from the flags list or from a flag's **Targeting** tab.

If you have the LaunchDarkly Slack app installed, you will automatically receive notifications in Slack about any changes to flags you have followed. To learn more about the Slack app, read [Slack](/integrations/slack).

To follow a flag from the flags list:

1. Navigate to the flags list.
2. Click the overflow menu for the flag you want to follow.
3. Click "Follow flag."

To unfollow a flag from the flags list, click **Unfollow** in the overflow menu.
