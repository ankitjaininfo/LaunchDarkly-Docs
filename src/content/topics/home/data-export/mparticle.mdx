## Overview

This topic explains how to create and test an mParticle destination for Data Export.

mParticle is a customer data platform that allows you to aggregate your analytics and create customer cohorts.

## Prerequisites

To set up an mParticle destination in LaunchDarkly, you need:

- Your mParticle server-to-server key
- Your mParticle server-to-server secret

The key and secret are available in your mParticle account. Copy and save both strings. You'll need them to connect mParticle to LaunchDarkly.

Here is an image of the mParticle API keys dialog:

## Creating the mParticle destination in LaunchDarkly

You can use the LaunchDarkly UI to create and modify destinations for Data Export.

To create an mParticle destination in LaunchDarkly:

1. Navigate to the **[Integrations](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations)** page and find "mParticle."

![mParticle on the "Integrations" page.](mparticle-add-destination.png)

2. Click **Add integration.** The "Create a destination" panel appears.
3. (Optional) Enter a **Name** for the destination.
4. Select an **Environment** for this destination to receive events from.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Environment settings are permanent</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You cannot change an environment after you create the destination. If you wish to export event data from a different environment, you must set up another destination.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

5. Select an **mParticle Environment**.
6. Enter your mParticle server-to-server key in the **API key** field.
7. Enter your mParticle server-to-server secret in the **API secret** field:

8. Select a **User Identifier** type from the menu:

![The "User identifier" menu.](mparticle-user-id.png)

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Choose the correct user identifier for your events</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The user identifier you choose must match an identity you chose to identify users in the mParticle ecosystem. Every event LaunchDarkly exports has a user key specified by the SDK.

The user identifier should correspond to the mParticle user identity your SDK user key represents. For example, if your user key represents an email address, you should choose `email` as the user identifier.

To learn more about exported events, read [Schema reference](/home/data-export/schema-reference).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

10. (Optional) If you use anonymous users, select the **Anonymous user identifier** type from the menu.

If you select this user type, you must also configure your mParticle SDK to send an `alias` event. `Alias` events connect an anonymous user ID with the user ID of a known user. This ensures that your users are identified and counted accurately. LaunchDarkly SDKs also support `alias` events, but in this case you must send the `alias` event from the mParticle SDK.

To learn more about `alias` events in mParticle, read [mParticle's documentation on associating anonymous and known users](https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/aliasing/).

11. Check the checkbox indicating you consent to the Integration Terms and Conditions.
12. Click **Save destination**.

The mParticle destination appears in the "Your data export destinations" section of the **Integrations** screen.

## Testing an mParticle destination

After you save the destination, send a test event to confirm that the destination is configured properly.

To send a test event:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page and find "mParticle."
2. Click into the "mParticle" section to display a list of destinations.
3. Click the **edit** icon next to the destination you want to test. The "Edit destination" panel appears.
4. In the "Send a test event" section, click **Send event**:

![The "Send a test event" section of the "Edit destination" panel.](mparticle-test-event.png)

5. Verify the event appears on the mParticle events live stream.

## Example events

These example events display the structure of the events LaunchDarkly sends to mParticle.

LaunchDarkly sends events in the following formats:

## Enabling Data Export for flags and environments

After you create a Data Export destination, you must start sending flag or environment event data to it. You can enable Data Export for individual flags, or for all the flags in an environment.

To learn more about exporting event data from flags and environments, read [Data Export](/home/data-export#exporting-event-data-for-flags-and-environments).

## Deleting an mParticle destination

You can delete a Data Export destination from the **Integrations** screen.

To delete a destination:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page and find "mParticle."
2. Click into the "mParticle" section to display a list of destinations.
3. Click the **edit** icon next to the destination you wish to delete. The "Edit destination" panel appears.
4. Click **Delete destination**:
