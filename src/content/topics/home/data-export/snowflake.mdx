## Overview

This topic explains how to create and test a Snowflake destination for Data Export. 

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Exported Event Types</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Snowflake Data Export only exports flag evaluation events for flags used in an experiment.
        
</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

As a prerequisite to configuring the Snowflake integration, you must find the **Account Locator** for your Snowflake account. You can use the `current_account()` helper to find this. To learn how, read [Snowflake's documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/current_account).

Next, configure the Snowflake integration in LaunchDarkly. To do this, you need the **Account Locator** from your Snowflake account.

## Creating a Snowflake destination in LaunchDarkly

To create the Snowflake destination:

1. Navigate to the **[Integrations](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations)** page and find "Snowflake."
2. Click **Add integration.** The "Create a destination" panel appears.
3. (Optional) Give your integration a human-readable **Name**.
4. Choose an **Environment** for this integration to apply to.
5. Enter the Snowflake **Account Locator**:

6. Click **Save destination**. The new integration appears in the list of integrations.

## Testing a Snowflake destination

After you save the destination, send a test event to confirm that the destination is configured properly.

To send a test event:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page and find "Snowflake."
2. Click into the "Snowflake" section to display a list of destinations.
3. Click the **edit** icon next to the destination you want to test. The "Edit destination" panel appears.
4. In the "Send a test event" section, click **Send event**.
5. Verify the event appears in the Snowflake **Debugger**.

## Consuming shared data in Snowflake

After you have created your destination, LaunchDarkly will add you to a [secure share](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-secure-views) for you to consume your events.  
Create a database in your Snowflake account to query the shared data. 

You can create the database using the user interface (UI) or a Snowflake worksheet.

### Snowflake worksheet

Open a worksheet using an account that has access to the `accountadmin` role in Snowflake.
Use the code below to create a database from the share.  
Replace `<database_name>` with your chosen values.

{/* cSpell:disable csv content doesn't need to be spellchecked */}

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Creating the database">

```sql
use role accountadmin;

show shares;

desc share ACCOUNT_TO_BE_CREATED.SHARED_ACCESS;

create database <database_name> from share ACCOUNT_TO_BE_CREATED.SHARED_ACCESS;
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

{/* cSpell:enable */}

Use the following sample to grant `SELECT` permissions to any of your custom roles that require them.  
Replace `<database_name>` and `<role_name>` with your chosen values.

{/* cSpell:disable csv content doesn't need to be spellchecked */}

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Creating the database">

```sql
grant imported privileges on database <database_name> to <role_name>;
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

{/* cSpell:enable */}

## Example events

These example events display the structure of the events LaunchDarkly sends to Snowflake.

LaunchDarkly sends events in the following formats:

{/* cSpell:disable csv content doesn't need to be spellchecked */}

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Evaluation event">

```csv
ID,PROJECTID,ENVIRONMENTID,CONTEXTKIND,CONTEXTKEY,VARIATIONINDEX,VARIATIONVALUE,VARIATIONNAME,FLAGKEY,TIMESTAMP,SNOWFLAKEACCOUNTID
642aa35a545fbb000e123456,5866f3891cd8810a42123456,586c33cf1cd88133f9123456,user,5efa6ca891e30321f0123456,1,false,,enable-confluence-smart-links,2023-04-03 09:58:47.000,hs00696
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

{/* cSpell:enable */}

## Enabling Data Export for flags and environments

After you create a Data Export destination, you must start sending flag or environment event data to it. You can enable Data Export for individual flags, or for all the flags in an environment.

To learn more about exporting event data from flags and environments, read [Exporting event data for flags and environments](/home/data-export#exporting-event-data-for-flags-and-environments).

## Deleting a Snowflake destination

You can delete a Data Export destination from the **Integrations** screen.

To delete a destination:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page and find "Snowflake."
2. Click into the "Snowflake" section to display a list of destinations.
3. Click the **edit** icon next to the destination you wish to delete. The "Edit destination" panel appears.
4. Click **Delete destination**:
