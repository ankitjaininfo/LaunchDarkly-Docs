## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's Data Export feature to export and store flag, context, and Experimentation event data.

Data Export provides a real-time export of raw analytics data, including feature flag requests, analytics events, custom events, Experimentation events, and more. By exporting your data to a location of your choice, you can use your own data warehouse and tools to analyze event data.

You can also use the REST API: [Data Export destinations](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Data-Export-destinations)

## How Data Export works

Data Export works by sending data to one of our supported **destinations**. A destination is an external service which can receive and store the data.

We support the following export destinations:

<ChildPageList path="/home/data-export" omit="/home/data-export/schema-reference" />

To learn more about event formatting, read [Schema reference](/home/data-export/schema-reference).

Some Data Export destinations have different event formatting schema. If you use mParticle or Segment as your event destination, we have specific documentation for their event schema.

* [Segment schema reference](/home/data-export/segment-schema-reference)

## Exporting event data for flags and environments

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>You must configure your SDKs to send events</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

To use Data Export, all of your SDKs must be configured to send events. If you have disabled sending events for testing purposes, you must re-enable it. To learn more about the events SDKs send to LaunchDarkly, read [Analytics events](/sdk/concepts/events).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you create a Data Export destination, you can send data to it for individual flags or for all the flags in an environment.

### Exporting flag event data

To export data from a specific flag to a destination:

1. Navigate to the flags list.
2. Click the name of the flag you wish to export data from.
3. Click the **Settings** tab.
4. Select the **Send detailed events to data export destinations** checkbox.
5. Click **Save changes**:

### Understanding Data Export and Experimentation events

If you check a flag's **Send detailed events to data export destinations** checkbox, then LaunchDarkly exports evaluation events for all contexts that encounter the flag.

If you do not check the **Send detailed events to data export destinations** checkbox, then LaunchDarkly does not export evaluation events, unless you are using the flag in an experiment. If you are using the flag in an experiment, then LaunchDarkly will still export evaluation events for contexts included in the experiment, but no other contexts.

You can tell if an evaluation was part of an experiment from the optional `inExperiment` attribute. Evaluations that were part of an experiment have the `inExperiment` attribute on the evaluation reason set to `true`. To learn more, read [Evaluation reasons](/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons).

### Exporting environment event data

When you export event data from an environment, LaunchDarkly exports all data from every new flag you create after you enable Data Export. It does not send event data from flags created before you enabled Data Export.

To export data from an environment to a destination:

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click the **Projects** tab.
3. Click on the name of the project containing the environment you want to export data from. The **Environments** tab appears.
4. Click on the **overflow menu** next to the environment you wish to export data from.
5. Choose "Edit environment." The "Edit environment" panel appears.
6. Select the **Send detailed events to data export destinations** checkbox.
7. Click **Save environment**:

## Delivery guarantees

After your application has successfully sent an event to our servers, we will send the event to your configured destinations at least once.

An event is sent to your destinations exactly once, with some exceptions. In the event of a hardware failure or networking issue, we may send events multiple times.

Additionally, if your configured destination does not acknowledge receipt of the event, we will retry sending the message five times over a 30 minute period.
