## Overview

This topic explains Experimentation events and how they work.

## Understanding Experimentation events

An Experimentation event is any event an SDK produces that impacts your experimentation event count. There are two categories of Experimentation events:

- **Metric events**: `click`, `page view`, and `custom` events from metrics used in running experiments.
- **Evaluation events**: `feature` events from flags with targeting rules included in running experiments.

Here are examples of each event:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Click metric event">

```json
{
  "kind": "click",
  "key": "click-metric-key-123abc",
  "url": "https://example.com/",
  "creationDate": 16420388151234,
  "selector": "button.click-track"
  "contextKeys": {
    "user": "Sandy",
    "anonymousUser": "123213421231"
  }
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Feature evaluation event">

```json
{
  "kind": "feature",
  "creationDate": 1462220944000,
  "key": "flag-key-123abc",
  "variation": 0,
  "variationName": "my variation",
  "value": false,
  "default": false,
  "version": 42,
  "reason": {
    "inExperiment": "true"
  },
  "prereqOf": "prereq-flag-key-123abc",
  "contextKeys": {
    "user": "sandy",
    "anonymousUser": "123213421231"
  }
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

### Understanding metric events

Server-side, client-side, and mobile LaunchDarkly SDKs send `custom` metric events when you call the SDK's track method.

<LearnMoreSdk>

Try it in your SDK: [Sending custom events](/sdk/features/events)

</LearnMoreSdk>

In addition, the JavaScript SDK also sends a `click` metric event when an end user clicks on a page URL or anchor tag that you have included in a click conversion metric, and sends a `page view` metric event when an end user visits a URL that you have included in a page view conversion metric.

You can view metric events on the **Live events** page using the **Experiments** filter.

If you prefer to import metric events from your existing data pipeline, read [Importing metric events](/home/creating-experiments/import-metric-events).

### Understanding evaluation events

Server-side, client-side, and mobile LaunchDarkly SDKs send a `feature` event when you call the SDK's `variation` method to evaluate a flag in an experiment. To learn more about the `variation` method, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating).

The JavaScript SDK and JavaScript-based SDKs also send a `feature` event when you call the SDK's `allFlags` method, unless you configure it not to.

<LearnMoreSdk>

Try it in your SDK: [Getting all flags](/sdk/features/all-flags#javascript)

</LearnMoreSdk>

Although it is a JavaScript-based SDK, the React Web SDK's default configuration is to not send a event when you call the `allFlags` method. To learn more about events in the React Web SDK, read [Events](/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#events).

Configuring the JavaScript SDK and JavaScript-based SDKs not to send `feature` events when you call `allFlags` can help keep your Experimentation costs down. To learn more about how SDKs send events, read [Analytics events](/sdk/concepts/events).

## Managing Experimentation billing costs

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>You may be billed for experiment keys instead of events</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Customers on newer contracts are billed by unique experiment context keys, rather than by event count. To learn more, read [Experiment pricing](/home/about-experimentation#experiment-pricing). If you are unsure about how you are being billed for Experimentation, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/) or your LaunchDarkly Account Executive.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Every time an end user triggers a metric that is attached to a running experiment, your Experimentation event count increases by one. If you are being billed by event count, you may want to reduce your Experimentation event counts to control billing costs. You can manage your event counts by not calling variation and track methods unnecessarily.

### Decreasing metric events

To reduce `page view` and `click` metric events, first update your metrics to use `custom` instead of `click` or `page view` where possible. Then, reduce `custom` metric events by limiting the number of times you call track.

You can also cache when you call track to ensure you call it only once per context.

### Decreasing evaluation events

To reduce evaluation events, cache or persist the response from the SDK, so that you only call the variation method when when you want to register an impression, or when you don't have the response cached or persisted.

You can also decrease the number of targets in an experiment using audience allocation. To learn how, read [Allocating experiment audiences](/home/creating-experiments/allocation).

## Correlating variations and conversions

A conversion is when a user action provides a measurable value for a metric. For example, if a metric is tracking clicks on a checkout button, LaunchDarkly registers a conversion each time an end user clicks the button. The SDK sends a track call to register the conversion in LaunchDarkly.

LaunchDarkly uses variation calls to correlate the variation an end user received to a conversion within a 90-day window. If there are more than 90 days between the time of a variation call and a track call on a user key, then LaunchDarkly does not register the metric in the experiment.

<LearnMoreSdk>

Try it in your SDK: [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating), [Sending custom events](/sdk/features/events)

</LearnMoreSdk>

In rare cases, unexpected behavior may cause an end user to receive multiple variations in the 90 days prior to a conversion. In these cases, LaunchDarkly attributes the conversion to the first variation the end user received in that 90-day period.
