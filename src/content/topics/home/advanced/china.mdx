## Overview

Some customers and end users in China have had difficulty maintaining a persistent connection to LaunchDarkly.

While LaunchDarkly is a product with global reach, inconsistencies between the internet services of different countries can make it difficult to predict where we might have outages. Some customers have reported difficulty maintaining a connection to LaunchDarkly from China. We believe this is because of our content delivery network (CDN) provider [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/)'s limited support in China.

We offer these customers the following alternatives to a conventional LaunchDarkly process.

## Remediation options

There are two options for improving performance if you're trying to use LaunchDarkly in China:

### Bootstrapping

To learn more, read [Bootstrapping](/sdk/features/bootstrapping#javascript).

- **Pros**: This is quick and easy to do, and will reduce startup time to near zero.

- **Cons**: If you bootstrap from local storage, end users might initially receive outdated flag variations. New variation updates will still suffer from inconsistent performance.

### Creating a Relay Proxy in China

To learn more, read [The Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy).

- **Pros**: This serves as a replacement for Fastly in China, and will be able to serve your clients much faster.

- **Cons**: This is much more complicated to set up than bootstrapping.
