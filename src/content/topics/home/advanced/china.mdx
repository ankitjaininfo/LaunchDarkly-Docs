## Overview

Some customers and end users in China have had difficulty maintaining a persistent connection to LaunchDarkly.

While LaunchDarkly is a product with global reach, inconsistencies between the internet services of different countries can make it difficult to predict where we might have outages. Some customers have reported difficulty maintaining a connection to LaunchDarkly from China.

We offer these customers the following alternatives to a conventional LaunchDarkly process.

## Remediation options

There are two options for improving performance if you're using LaunchDarkly in China: bootstrapping, or creating a Relay Proxy.

### Bootstrapping

The pros and cons of bootstrapping include:
- **Pros**: This is quick and easy to do, and will reduce startup time to near zero.
- **Cons**: If you bootstrap from local storage, end users might initially receive outdated flag variations. New variation updates will still suffer from inconsistent performance.

### Creating a Relay Proxy

The pros and cons of using the Relay Proxy include:
- **Pros**: This may be able to serve your clients much faster.
- **Cons**: This is much more complicated to set up than bootstrapping.
