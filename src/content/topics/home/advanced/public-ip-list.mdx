## Overview

This topic explains how to access LaunchDarkly through one of our public IPs. If you're using a firewall, add a LaunchDarkly IP range to your firewall settings.

## Accessing LaunchDarkly through a public IP range

To help you access LaunchDarkly services through your firewall, we provide a list of LaunchDarkly's public IP ranges.

Access the list of public IP ranges from this URL:

<CodeSample>
  <CSTab label="Access public IP ranges">

  ```bash
    https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/public-ip-list
  ```
  ```bash site=federal
    https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/public-ip-list
  ```

  </CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The public IP endpoint returns a JSON object with two attributes:

- `addresses`: This element contains the IP addresses LaunchDarkly uses.
- `outboundAddresses`: This element contains the IP addresses LaunchDarkly uses for outbound webhook-based notifications and integrations. LaunchDarkly uses these addresses when making calls to your network.

You can automate calls to this API to detect when the IP ranges change. We post upcoming changes to this list in advance on our [status page](https://status.launchdarkly.com/).
