## Overview

This topic explains how to configure and deploy the Relay Proxy.

## Configuring the Relay Proxy

After you have downloaded or built the Relay Proxy, you need to set its configuration options. 

You can set these options by either:
- using a configuration file, or 
- using environment variables.

If you are using Relay Proxy Enterprise, you can also use automatic configuration. To learn more, read [Automatic configuration](/home/relay-proxy/automatic-configuration).

Expand each section below to learn how to configure the Relay Proxy.

<Details summary="Expand Using a configuration file">

### Using a configuration file

It's common to use a configuration file when you deploy the Relay Proxy from a release binary or build it from source.

You can also use a configuration file when you run the Relay Proxy from a Docker container, but it is less convenient to do because you *must* place the configuration file at `/ldr/ld-relay.conf`.

To use a configuration file:

1. Create a new file:

  <CodeSample>
  <CSTab label="Basic example">

  ```text
  # A single environment which only proxies server-side SDKs
  [environment "environment-key-123abc"]
      sdkKey = "sdk-key-123abc"
  ```

  </CSTab>
  <CSTab label="Multiple environments">

  ```text
  # An environment which proxies SDKs with SDK keys or client-side IDs
  [environment "Production"]
      sdkKey = "sdk-key-123abc"
      envId = "environment-key-123abc"

  # An environment which proxies SDKs with SDK keys or mobile keys
  [environment "Mobile Production"]
      sdkKey = "sdk-key-123abc"
      mobileKey = "mobile-key-123abc"
  ```

  </CSTab>
  </CodeSample>

  To learn more about the supported configuration options, read [Configuration](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/blob/v7/docs/configuration.md) in the Relay Proxy GitHub repository.

2. Run the Relay Proxy binary while passing an argument to identify your configuration file's location. The following example assumes that the configuration file is in your current directory and named `ld-relay.conf`, and that the `ld-relay` binary is in `$GOPATH/bin`.

  Run the following code:

  <CodeSample>
  <CSTab label="Run the binary">

  ```bash
  $GOPATH/bin/ld-relay --config ./ld-relay.conf
  ```

  </CSTab>
  </CodeSample>

If you're using Relay Proxy Enterprise and want to enable automatic configuration or offline mode, read [Enabling automatic configuration](/home/relay-proxy/automatic-configuration#enabling-automatic-configuration) or [Enabling offline mode](/home/relay-proxy/offline#enabling-offline-mode).
</Details>

<Details summary="Expand Using environment variables">

### Using environment variables

The other way to configure your Relay Proxy is with environment variables. This method is available regardless of how you deploy the Relay Proxy, although it is most commonly used with Docker containers.

To use environment variables:

1. Confirm that all of your Relay Proxy configuration values are specified with the appropriate environment variables.

  For example, to specify the SDK key for an environment named `MyEnvName`:

  <CodeSample>
  <CSTab label="Example environment variable">

  ```bash
  export LD_ENV_MyEnvName=<sdk-key-123abc>
  ```

  </CSTab>
  </CodeSample>

  To learn more about supported environment variables, read [Configuration file format and environment variables](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/blob/v7/docs/configuration.md#configuration-file-format-and-environment-variables) in the Relay Proxy GitHub repository.

2. Run the Relay Proxy binary while passing the `--from-env` argument. The following command assumes that the `ld-relay` binary is in `$GOPATH/bin`.

  <CodeSample>
  <CSTab label="Run the binary">

  ```bash
  $GOPATH/bin/ld-relay --from-env
  ```

  </CSTab>
  </CodeSample>

If you're using Relay Proxy Enterprise and want to enable automatic configuration or offline mode, read [Enabling automatic configuration](/home/relay-proxy/automatic-configuration#enabling-automatic-configuration) or [Enabling offline mode](/home/relay-proxy/offline#enabling-offline-mode).
</Details>

## Deploying the Relay Proxy

You can deploy the Relay Proxy in one of four ways. In order from most common to least common uses, the methods are:

* starting the Relay Proxy from a Docker image,
* using Helm to run the Relay Proxy in Kubernetes,
* downloading a Relay Proxy release binary, or
* building the Relay Proxy from source.

Expand the sections below to learn how to use each method.

<Details summary="Expand Starting the Relay Proxy from a Docker image">

### Starting the Relay Proxy from a Docker image

You can start the Relay Proxy from the `launchdarkly/ld-relay` image, which is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/launchdarkly/ld-relay).

To deploy the Relay Proxy with Docker:

1. Use `docker pull` to pull the latest Relay Proxy Docker image:

  <CodeSample>
  <CSTab label="Update your Docker container">

  ```bash
  docker pull launchdarkly/ld-relay
  ```

  </CSTab>
  </CodeSample>

2. Use `docker run` to run the Relay Proxy from your Docker container while specifying your configuration details.

The simplest way to specify the configuration is with environment variables, using the `-e` option of `docker run`. An example configuration that uses environment variables appears below.

For examples and a full list of allowable variables, read the documentation in the GitHub repository on [Using with Docker](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/blob/v7/docs/docker.md) and [Configuration](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/blob/v7/docs/configuration.md).

In the following example, the Relay Proxy is configured to have two LaunchDarkly environments.

For the first environment, the SDK key is `staging-sdk-key-123abc`, and the environment name, for the purposes of logging, is `Staging`. For the second environment, the SDK key is `prod-sdk-key-456def`, and the environment name is `Production`.

In this example, the Relay Proxy is configured to listen on port 8030, which is its default port.

The example configuration follows:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Run with a Docker container">

 ```bash
docker run --name ld-relay              \
     -e LD_ENV_Staging="staging-sdk-key-123abc" \
     -e LD_ENV_Prod="prod-sdk-key-456def"       \
     -p 8030:8030                        \
     -e PORT=8030                        \
     launchdarkly/ld-relay
 ```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

</Details>

<Details summary="Expand Using Helm to run the Relay Proxy in Kubernetes">

### Using Helm to run the Relay Proxy in Kubernetes

We maintain a [Helm chart](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay-helm) to ease Kubernetes-based Relay Proxy deployments.

To deploy the Relay Proxy using this Helm chart:

1. Add the LaunchDarkly Relay Proxy Helm chart repository.

  <CodeSample>
  <CSTab label="Add chart repository">

  ```bash
  helm repo add launchdarkly-ld-relay https://launchdarkly.github.io/ld-relay-helm
  ```
  </CSTab>
  </CodeSample>

2. Use `helm install` to install the chart archive and deploy the proxy into your cluster.

  The fastest way to configure installation is through Helm's `--set` flag. However, we recommend using files with the `--values` flag as this enables easier long term maintenance. In the examples below, replace `MyEnvironment` with the name of your Relay Proxy environment and `sdk-key` with your SDK key.

  Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Using command line flags">

```bash
helm install relay --set relay.environment.LD_ENV_environment-key-123abc=sdk-key123bc launchdarkly-ld-relay/ld-relay
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Using values file">

```yaml
# values.yaml
relay:
    environment:
        LD_ENV_environment-key-123abc: sdk-key123bc

# Run on the terminal
helm install relay --values ./values.yaml launchdarkly-ld-relay/ld-relay
```
</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can find examples and full documentation on all configuration options in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay-helm).

<Details summary="Expand Downloading a Relay Proxy release binary">

### Downloading a Relay Proxy release binary

You can download one of the Relay Proxy's most recent release binaries from our GitHub repository. This repository has all versions of the Relay Proxy releases with details about what each release improves or fixes. We recommend using the most recent release.

To learn more about Relay Proxy release binaries, [visit the GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/releases).

If you want to download a release binary from the GitHub repository, you should know the following things:
* **tar.gz** files are executables. You can use these to run the Relay Proxy directly.
* **.deb** and **.rpm** files are intended for use with a package manager.

When executing the binary, you'll need to tell the Relay Proxy about your desired configuration. You can do so either with a configuration file or environment variables. Continue reading for more information.
</Details>

<Details summary="Expand Building the Relay Proxy from source">

### Building the Relay Proxy from source

To build the Relay Proxy from source:

1. Install Go 1.16 or higher. To install Go, read [Go's documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. Check out the source code from the default branch of the repository: https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay
3. In the directory where you checked out the code, run this command: `go build .`

After you do this, the executable binary `ld-relay` appears in the directory.

There is also a shortcut command that can replace the longer procedure above. This command downloads the code and builds it in a single step. After you enter the command, the executable binary `ld-relay` appears in `$GOPATH/bin`. You can move it to any other location.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Download and build the Relay Proxy">

```bash
go install github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/v6@latest
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

When you execute the binary, you must tell the Relay Proxy about your desired configuration. You can do this either with a configuration file or environment variables.
