## Overview

This topic explains how to implement the Relay Proxy.

Before you begin, decide whether the Relay Proxy is appropriate for your configuration by reading [Relay Proxy use cases](/home/relay-proxy/use-cases).

If you are a customer on an Enterprise plan, [Relay Proxy Enterprise](/home/relay-proxy/enterprise) has additional functionality available.

## Relay Proxy implementation

Before you implement the the Relay Proxy, read the [Relay Proxy guidelines](/home/relay-proxy/guidelines).

Here is the process for implementing the Relay Proxy:

1. Decide whether to configure your SDKs for [proxy mode or daemon mode](/home/relay-proxy/using#configuring-sdks-to-use-different-modes).
1. Plan your Relay Proxy architecture, including:
    - [Whether you must use a persistent store](/home/relay-proxy/using#using-a-persistent-store), such as with Big Segments.
    - What servers to use.
    - How to manage load balancing.
1. [Configure the Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy/deploying#configuring-the-relay-proxy).
    - (Optional) [Configure the Relay Proxy for Big Segments](/home/relay-proxy/using#configuring-the-relay-proxy-for-big-segments), if applicable.
    - (Optional) If you're using Relay Proxy Enterprise, set up [automatic configuration](/home/relay-proxy/automatic-configuration) or configure [offline mode](/home/relay-proxy/offline).
1. [Deploy the Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy/deploying#deploying-the-relay-proxy).
1. [Configure your SDKs to use the Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy/using).
1. [Plan for scaling](/home/relay-proxy/guidelines#scaling-guidelines).
1. [Monitor the Relay Proxy's performance](/home/relay-proxy/monitoring) over time.
