## Understanding the differences between Relay Proxy and Relay Proxy Enterprise

The core set of features in the Relay Proxy is available to all customers, whether you're on a Starter, Professional, or Enterprise plan. To learn more about what features are available to all customers, read [The Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy).

Enterprise customers can take advantage of additional features that make the Relay Proxy more secure and faster to configure. We recommend that all customers on Enterprise plans who are primarily feature flagging in server-side applications use Relay Proxy Enterprise.
