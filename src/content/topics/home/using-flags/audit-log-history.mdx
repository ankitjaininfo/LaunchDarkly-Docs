The **Audit log** is a running tally of changes made to feature flags in a given environment. You can access the audit log from the sidenav.

The audit log displays changes to feature flags for your current environment only. To view the changes for other environments, use the **Switch environment** menu at the top of your sidenav.

By default, the audit log displays the most recent ten entries. You can use the date picker to change the date range of entries the audit log displays.

Here is an image of the audit log:

Click the **Details** button for more information about each change. JSON patch changes include representations of the JSON patch operation, and a diff from the old and new JSON, if available.

## Using the history tabs

The user interface (UI) also contains **History** tabs on the **Account settings**, **Feature flags**, and **Segments** pages, as well as on individual team and member pages. These contain a record of the changes made in LaunchDarkly to those resources.
