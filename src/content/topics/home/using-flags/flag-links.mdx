## Overview

This topic explains how to create and use flag links to view external mentions of flags from other tools and services. Links to external conversations and references to your flags allow you to collaborate more easily and quickly review relevant flag information.

You can create flag links automatically using Slack, Jira, and Trello integrations. You can also create them manually using a URL to any system, tool, or site you wish.

There are four types of flag links:

* [URL flag links](#creating-url-flag-links)
* [Slack flag links](#creating-slack-flag-links)
* [Jira flag links](#creating-jira-flag-links)
* [Trello flag links](#creating-trello-flag-links)


## Creating URL flag links

You can create URL flag links by associating an external URL with a feature flag.

To create a URL flag link:

1. Find the feature flag you want to add a link to on the flags list.
2. Click the flag's name. The flag's **Targeting** page opens.
3. Click the **Links** tab.
4. Click **Add link**. The "Add link to flag" screen appears:

5. Enter the URL for the external resource you're linking the flag to.
6. (Optional) Enter a title and description for the link.
6. Click **Save**. The modal closes and the linked resource appears underneath the date you created the link.
