## Overview

This category explains how to use a flag's **Targeting** tab to control which of your customers receive a variation of a feature flag, based on their context. Configuring which contexts receive which variation of a flag is referred to as a flag's targeting.

## Using the Targeting tab

You can use the **Targeting** tab to roll features out for internal testing, private betas, or usability tests before performing a broader rollout. You can even set expiration dates for flag targeting if you know you only want customers to receive a flag for a specific period of time.

The **Targeting** tab uses the language of targeted "contexts." Contexts are people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. You can target end users of your application, devices, systems, organizations, or anything else that can be uniquely identified.
