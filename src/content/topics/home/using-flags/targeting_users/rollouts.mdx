## Overview

This topic explains how to use percentage rollouts to release new features to users incrementally.

Percentage rollouts let you manage the risk of deployment by releasing a feature to users gradually. You can roll out your feature to a small percentage of random users and, as you become more confident your feature is working as intended, increase the percentage over time.

## Creating percentage rollouts

You can create a percentage rollout in a flag's targeting rule or a flag's default rule.

Here is an image of a percentage rollout in a default rule:

In this example, 25% of users will receive the new feature. If the new feature works as expected, you can increase the percentage of users receiving the new feature incrementally, until it eventually reaches 100%.

If you want to roll out a variation to a very small percentage of your users, you can assign less than 1% to a variation. You can use up to three decimal places, for example, 0.125%.

You can use workflows to automate the process of changing rollout percentages over time. To learn how, read [Workflows](/home/feature-workflows/workflows).

## Understanding percentage rollout logic

When you set up a percentage rollout, each user receives a particular variation based on their user key.

The percentage rollout logic generates a hash based on both user attributes and the flag's key. The SDK uses this hash to generate a percentage value for that user. That value, compared to the value set for the percentage rollout value, determines which variation a user receives. The hash has partitions from 1 to 100,000. When you assign flag variations, the hash assigns values from 1 to 100,000 to users in each partition, in order. For example, when you assign 50% to variation A, LaunchDarkly serves variation A to hash partitions from 1 to 50,000.

A common use case for percentage rollouts is to increment the percentage of users targeted by a flag over time until 100% of the users receive one variation of a flag. When you change the percentage allocation of users to flag variations, those users are reassigned different flag variations based on their partition's position in the 1 to 100,000 hash list. For example, if you change the percentage of users receiving variation A from 50% to 70%, partitions 50,001 to 70,000 would be added to the set of partitions already receiving variation A.

## Using advanced rollouts

You can assign variations to users based on any user attribute in the **Advanced** menu.

For example, you can roll out a feature to 25% of users, but instead of being assigned to a variation randomly, users will be assigned to a variation based on the value of their `country` attribute. This ensures that LaunchDarkly assigns all users with matching attribute-value pairs to the same variation.

Here is an image of an advanced rollout:

The attribute must have either string values or integer numeric values. If you use a custom attribute with a numeric value that includes a fraction, or has a value type besides `string` or `number`, then the SDK cannot use the attribute value and assigns the user to an arbitrary variation.

### Maintaining user experience across anonymous and logged-in states

To associate pre-login (anonymous user) behaviors with post-login (known user) behaviors to get a singular view of a user flow, you should use a custom attribute and the advanced option for percentage rollouts that allows you to rollout based on a different attribute. 

Here's how to do this:

1. Store a unique identifier for the anonymous user into a cookie. A session ID or UUID works well.
2. Use this unique identifier as both the user's key and a custom attribute until the user logs in. The custom attribute can be named anything, but for this example it is named `uniqueId`.
3. While the user is logged in, set the user's key to their real (primary) user key, but continue to use the unique identifier stored in the cookie as the user's `uniqueId` custom attribute.
4. For all flags, or for those that may affect logged out users, use the advanced option for all percentage rollouts to do rollouts based on the `uniqueId` custom attribute.

<CalloutTitle><code>secondary</code> attribute</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The <code>secondary</code> attribute is a special attribute. The SDKs incorporate this attribute into the variation bucket assignment hash automatically when it is included in your user object. Unlike other attributes, you cannot use the <code>secondary</code> attribute in targeting rules.
