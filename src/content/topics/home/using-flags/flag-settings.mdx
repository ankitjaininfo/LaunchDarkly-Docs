## Overview

This topic explains how to make other changes to your feature flags in the flag's **Settings** tab.

A feature flag's **Settings** tab lets you change flag settings, including the name and description of the flag. Some settings apply only to the currently selected environment, while others apply across all environments. You can also clone or archive a flag from this tab.

## Settings for the current environment

Both data export settings and flag triggers are specific to the current environment.

Here is an image of the settings for the current environment on the flag's **Settings** tab:

### Sending detailed event information

LaunchDarkly summarizes flag evaluation events by default to minimize data use, and limits events transmission to 100 MBps.

If you use Data Export, you can enable it to send detailed event data for a given flag. You can adjust this setting for each environment in the project.

To learn more, read [Data Export](/home/data-export).

### Changing flag targeting remotely

Flag triggers let you make changes to flag targeting remotely from a third-party application, such as an APM tool. You can use triggers to turn flag targeting on or off. You can enable flag triggers for each environment in the project.

To learn more, read [Flag triggers](/home/feature-workflows/triggers).

## Settings for all environments

The majority of flag settings apply to all environments.

Here is an image of the settings for all environments on the flag's **Settings** tab:

### Maintainer

The flag maintainer is the account member who is primarily responsible for the flag. By default, the maintainer is set to the member who created the flag, but you can assign any member of your team as the maintainer for a particular flag.

Enterprise customers using [teams](/home/teams) can assign a team as the flag's maintainer. This offers the additional benefit of shared accountability and also ensures that when one member leaves the team, the flag still has other owners.

### Name, description

You can change the flag's name and description here.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Flag keys are permanent</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

In addition to the descriptors, every flag has a unique key which you set during flag creation. Be thoughtful when you create a new flag key. You cannot change it after you save the flag.

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

### Tags

Tags are labels that help you categorize flags. They're especially helpful for managing flag permissions with custom roles. For example, you can tag flags with `marketing` flags or `devOps` tags, and then use these tags to determine who has read or write access for the flag.

### Permanent flags

You can mark flags permanent if they're intended to exist in your codebase long-term, for example, a flag that enables a site-wide maintenance mode. LaunchDarkly does not prompt you to remove permanent flags, even if one variation has been rolled out to all of your users. In addition, when someone attempts to remove a permanent flag, they receive a warning about the flag's permanent status.

### Client-side SDK availability

If you're using a client-side or mobile SDK, you must expose your feature flags in order for the client-side or mobile SDKs to evaluate them. To learn more, read [Making flags available to client-side and mobile SDKs](/home/getting-started/feature-flags#making-flags-available-to-client-side-and-mobile-sdks).

### Custom properties

You can use custom properties to connect individual flags to some LaunchDarkly integrations. To learn more, read [Custom properties](/home/connecting/custom-properties/).

## Cloning a flag

You can create new flags by cloning existing flags. When you clone a flag, LaunchDarkly makes a new flag and copies the original flag's targeting configuration for all environments. To learn more, read [Cloning flags](/home/getting-started/feature-flags#cloning-flags).

## Archiving a flag

You can archive a flag if you want to retire it from LaunchDarkly without deleting it. Archived flags are archived across all environments. To learn more, read [Archiving flags](/home/code/flag-archive#archiving-flags).
