## Overview

This topic explains how to archive flags you no longer need, or delete flags that are archived.

When a flag is no longer being served to customers, and it is not a prerequisite of other flags, it may be time to archive it. Archiving a flag retires it from LaunchDarkly without deleting it. You can restore an archived flag if you need it, or find it to reference its configuration later.

LaunchDarkly will not let you archive a flag that is a prerequisite of other flags. Flags are good candidates for archival when they are serving only one variation in the environment you choose and have not been requested in the last seven days.

When you archive a flag in LaunchDarkly, you should also remove the flag from your code. LaunchDarkly's code references feature can help you quickly identify all the places a flag is referenced in your code. To learn more, read [Code references](/home/code/code-references).

If you do not remove a flag from your code after you archive it, then all end users encountering the feature will receive the flag's fallback value.

You can delete an archived flag after you determine your project no longer needs it.

## Archiving flags

To archive a flag:

1. Navigate to the flags list.
2. Find the flag you wish to archive and click the **overflow menu**.
3. Choose "Archive." The "Archive this flag?" panel appears. If the flag has dependencies, you cannot archive it:

![A flag that cannot be archived due to dependencies.](flag-cannot-archive.png)

To learn how to resolve flag dependencies, read [Resolving dependencies](#resolving-dependencies).

3. Choose the environments your team or customers depend on to confirm you can archive the flag from those environments without unintended consequences. Verify that the flag is not in use by reviewing its states in the flag archive fields:

![A flag with no dependencies that prevent it from being archived.](flag-can-archive.png)

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Archiving a flag removes it from every environment in your project</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

All flags exist in every environment for a project, but often only a few environments matter for your organization's production processes. Archiving a flag will remove it from every environment in the project. Be absolutely certain you can archive a flag without any unintended impact.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

4. Type the flag's name in the **Archive flag** text box.
5. Click **Archive**.

The flag is archived and removed from the flags list. You can find it in the archived flags list. To learn more, read [Viewing and restoring archived flags](#viewing-and-restoring-archived-flags).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Archived flags serve their coded values if requested</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If end users request a flag after you archive it, the flag value that returns is the value you defined in code.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Archived flags are indicated with a grey and white striped background:

You can also archive a flag from the flag's **Settings** tab:

![The "Archive" option on a flag's "Settings" tab.](flag-settings-archive.png)

## Resolving dependencies

You cannot archive flags that are prerequisites of other flags. If you attempt to archive a prerequisite flag, the "Archive this flag?" panel prevents you from doing so.

Here is a screenshot of the "Archive this flag?" panel:

![The "Archive this flag?" panel with dependencies that block it from being archived.](flag-cannot-archive.png)

If the flag is a prerequisite of other flags, you cannot archive it. You must remove the flag as a prerequisite before you can archive it.

Other dependencies will not stop you from archiving a flag, but we recommend resolving all dependencies before you archive a flag.

These dependencies are:

- The flag is serving multiple variations
- The flag has been requested in the last seven days

Here is a screenshot of the "Archive this flag?" panel:

![A flag with dependencies that do not block it from being archived.](flag-archive-mixed-dependencies.png)

## Viewing and restoring archived flags

Archived flags are visible from the flags list. Click the **overflow menu** choose the "View archived flags" option to view them:

![The "View archived flags" option.](flag-compare-archive-menu.png)


Archived flags appear on their own list, which is indicated with grey and white stripes:

![The "Archived feature flags" screen.](flag-archived.png)


To restore an archived flag:

1. Navigate to the "Archived feature flags" screen and find the flag you wish to restore.
2. In the **overflow menu**, choose "Restore." The "Restore this flag?" panel appears:

![An archived flag with the "Restore" option called out.](flag-archive-restore-callout.png)


3. Confirm that the flag state is such that restoring the flag will have no unexpected consequences.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Restoring a flag means it will be evaluated again</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you restore an archived flag, it returns to evaluation just like any other flag. This is why it is important to confirm that the flag will have no unexpected impact after you restore it.

</Callout>

4. Type the flag's name in the **Restore flag** text box.
5. Click **Restore**. The flag appears in the flags list:

![The "Restore this flag?" panel.](flag-archive-restore-confirm.png)


You can also restore an archived flag from the flag's **Settings** tab:

![The "Restore flag" section of the flag's "Settings" tab.](flag-settings-restore.png)


## Deleting archived flags

After you archive a flag, you can delete it if you no longer need it.

If you delete a flag, its rules will be deleted. Should it be requested again, the flag value defined in code will be returned for all contexts. Remove any references to the feature flag from your application code before you delete it.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Deleted flags are gone forever</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you delete a flag, you cannot restore it. Be absolutely certain you do not need a flag anymore before you delete it.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To delete an archived flag:

1. Click on the **overflow menu** (three horizontal lines) next to the **Create flag** button.
2. Choose "View archived flags." The "Archived feature flags" screen appears:

![The overflow menu with the "View archived flags" option selected.](flag-compare-archive-menu.png)

3. Find the flag you wish to delete.
4. Click **Delete**. The "Delete this flag?" dialog appears:

![The "Archived feature flags" screen with the "Delete" button called out.](flag-archive-delete-callout.png)


5. Type the flag's name in the confirmation text field to confirm.
6. Click **Delete**.

The flag is deleted permanently.
