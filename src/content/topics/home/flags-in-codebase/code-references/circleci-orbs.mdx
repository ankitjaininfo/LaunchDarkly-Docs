## Overview

This topic explains how you can use the `ld-find-code-refs` utility with CircleCI to automatically populate code references in LaunchDarkly.

## Prerequisites

To complete this procedure, you must have the following prerequisites:

- An API access token with write permissions for the `code-reference-repository` resource, either through the built-in Writer role or a custom role. To learn more, read [API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens) and [Code reference actions](/home/members/role-actions#code-reference-actions).
- The LaunchDarkly [CircleCI Orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Circle Workflow version 2.1 or higher is required</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

To use CircleCI code references, you must be using a Circle Workflow version of 2.1 or higher. If you're using an earlier version, try manually using the utility binary or docker image to create your own workflow job. To learn more, read [Execution via CLI](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/tree/main/README.md#execution-via-cli) in the `ld-find-code-refs` documentation.

## Setting up the LaunchDarkly CircleCI integration

To set up the LaunchDarkly orb in CircleCI:

1. Save your API access token as an environment variable titled `LD_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your CircleCI project settings. To learn more, read [CircleCI's documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).
2. Create a YAML file in CircleCI with configuration including LaunchDarkly's Orb.
   Here's an example minimal configuration using LaunchDarkly's Orb:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="YAML">

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  launchdarkly: launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs@2.7.0

workflows:
  main:
    jobs:
      - launchdarkly/find-code-references:
          proj_key: $YOUR_LAUNCHDARKLY_PROJECT_KEY
          repo_type: github # can be 'bitbucket', 'custom', 'github', or 'gitlab'
          repo_url: $YOUR_REPO_URL # used to generate links to your repository
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Additional configuration options

There are additional configuration options for the code references orb.

To skip searching files and directories, use an [`.ldignore`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#ignoring-files-and-directories) file.

To configure custom delimiters and aliases for your flag keys, or to set other advanced configuration, use the [`.launchdarkly/coderefs.yaml`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#advanced-yaml-configuration) file.
