## Overview

This topic explains how to use the `ld-find-code-refs` utility with Bitbucket code references to create code references in LaunchDarkly.

You can use the [`ld-find-code-refs`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/) utility with [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines) to automatically populate code references in LaunchDarkly. To do this, you must create a Pipes configuration using LaunchDarkly's [code reference pipe](https://bitbucket.org/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs-pipe).

## Prerequisites

To set up Bitbucket Pipes, you must have the following prerequisite:

- A Bitbucket Pipelines configuration file. To create one, navigate to the Pipelines section of your Bitbucket repository.
- An API access token with write permissions for the `code-reference-repository` resource, either through the built-in Writer role or a custom role. To learn more, read [API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens) and [Code reference actions](/home/members/role-actions#code-reference-actions).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>API tokens can also use custom roles</CalloutTitle>

<CalloutDescription>

Alternatively, you can give the access token access to a custom role with the `code-reference-repository` resource specifier. To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Setting up the Pipes configuration

To set up the Bitbucket Pipes configuration:

1. Create a new Pipeline configuration in your Bitbucket repository.
2. Configure the Pipeline to run on `push` using the `default` configuration. Include the following variables:

- `LD_ACCESS_TOKEN`: This secured variable should be your API access token.
- `LD_PROJ_KEY`: This should be your LaunchDarkly project key. Find it in **Account settings**, then **Projects**.

Here's an example of a minimal Pipeline configuration:

You can copy and paste the following code into a blank Pipelines configuration if you have set the `LD_PROJ_KEY` and `LD_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variables as repository variables:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="YAML">

```yaml
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        script:
          - pipe: launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs-pipe:2.7.0
            environment:
              LD_ACCESS_TOKEN: $LD_ACCESS_TOKEN
              LD_PROJ_KEY: $LD_PROJ_KEY
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn more about repository variables, read [Atlassian's documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/variables-in-pipelines-794502608.html).

3. Confirm that the pipeline is working by creating a new pull request with the workflow file and visiting the Pipelines page on your repository's webpage. If your pipeline fails, there may be a problem with your configuration. To investigate, check the pipeline's logs to view any error messages.

## Pipeline configuration

You may configure the [code reference pipe](https://bitbucket.org/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs-pipe) with additional environment variables to enable more functionality. For additional configuration options, read the [ld-find-code-refs-pipe repository](https://bitbucket.org/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs-pipe/src/master).
