## Overview

This topic explains what the different flag statuses are, and how to view them in the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI).

## Using the flag status indicator

The flag status indicator lets you view when a flag is active or inactive. It's important to understand flag statuses so you know which flags are safe to remove from your code.

Every feature flag has a status that reflects the state of a flag in each environment.

For example, if the flag is listed as "Active" in your Production environment, LaunchDarkly is currently receiving requests for that flag using your Production SDK key.

Here is a screenshot of flag status indicators on the **Feature flags** list:

## Flag status definitions

The various flag statuses are explained below:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Status type</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Name</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Definition</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
<TableCell>

![](flag-status-indicator-new.png)

</TableCell>
      <TableCell>New</TableCell>
      <TableCell>You created the flag fewer than seven days ago and it has never been requested.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
<TableCell>

![](flag-status-indicator-active.png)

</TableCell>
        <TableCell>Active</TableCell>
        <TableCell>LaunchDarkly is receiving requests for this flag, but there are either multiple variations configured, or it is toggled off, or there have been changes to configuration in the past seven days.
        </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
<TableCell>

![](flag-status-indicator-launched.png)

</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Launched</TableCell>
      <TableCell>LaunchDarkly is receiving requests for this flag, it is toggled on, there is only one variation configured, and there have been no changes to configuration in the past seven days.<br/><br/>You may be able to remove this flag from your code.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
<TableCell>

![](flag-status-indicator-inactive.png)

</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Inactive</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The flag has not been requested for at least seven days.<br/><br/>You may be able to remove this flag from your code.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

For example, if a flag is evaluated and returns the same variation each time to everyone who evaluates it in a seven-day period, and no configuration changes are made to the flag during that period, its status changes to "launched." If configuration changes are made to the flag during that period, its status changes to "active."

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Accelerate uses slightly different definitions</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you are part of the Accelerate Early Access Program, be aware that Accelerate uses slightly different definitions on the flag health metric view.

Accelerate defines a Launched flag as one for which the flag is toggled on, and over the past seven days, all context instances have been receiving one variation of the flag and there have been no changes to configuration.

Accelerate defines an Active flag as one for which some context instances have been receiving different variations of the flag, or it is toggled off, or there have been changes to configuration in the past seven days.
