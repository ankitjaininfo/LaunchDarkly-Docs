## Overview

This topic explains what the different flag statuses are, and how to view them in the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI).

## Using the flag status indicator

The flag status indicator lets you view when a flag is active or inactive. It's important to understand flag statuses so you know which flags are safe to remove from your code.

Every feature flag has a status that reflects the state of a flag in each environment.

For example, if the flag is listed as "Active" in your Production environment, LaunchDarkly is currently receiving requests for that flag using your Production SDK key.

Here is a screenshot of flag status indicators on the **Feature flags** list:

The various flag statuses are explained below:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Status type</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Name</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Definition</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
<TableCell>

</TableCell>
      <TableCell>New</TableCell>
      <TableCell>You created the flag fewer than seven days ago and it has never been requested.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
<TableCell>

![](flag-status-indicator-active.png)

</TableCell>
        <TableCell>Active</TableCell>
        <TableCell>LaunchDarkly is receiving requests for this flag.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
<TableCell>

![](flag-status-indicator-launched.png)

</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Launched</TableCell>
<TableCell>The launched icon appears when all context instances have been receiving one variation of this flag, with no configuration changes, for seven days or more. This includes the off variation.<br/>This is calculated by tracking flag evaluations and configuration changes over a seven-day period. For example, if a flag is evaluated and returns the same variation each time to everyone who evaluates it in a seven-day period, and no configuration changes are made to the flag during that period, its status changes to "launched."<br/>You may be able to remove this flag from your code.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
<TableCell>

![](flag-status-indicator-inactive.png)

</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Inactive</TableCell>
<TableCell>The flag has not been requested for at least seven days.<br/>You may be able to remove this flag from your code.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>
