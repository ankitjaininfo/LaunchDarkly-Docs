## Overview

This topic explains how to receive notifications in Microsoft Teams when someone changes a feature flag that you have subscribed to notifications for.

To use this feature, you must have installed and configured the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams app. To learn more, read [Setting up the Microsoft Teams app](/integrations/microsoft-teams/setting-up).

## Subscribing to flag notifications

You can subscribe to updates for flags, segments, metrics, projects, or environments. When someone updates a resource LaunchDarkly sends a notification of the change to all channels subscribed to updates for that resource.

There are two ways to subscribe to flag notifications:
* Follow a specific flag in LaunchDarkly. To learn more, read [Following flags](/home/organize/flags-list#following-flags).
* Create a subscription in Microsoft Teams.

### Creating a subscription in Microsoft Teams

You can create a subscription using the `subscribe` command with keyword arguments, or using the `subscribe` command with positional arguments. We recommend using keyword arguments. To view more information and examples of the subscribe command, run `@launchdarkly help subscribe` in a channel or direct message that the LaunchDarkly bot is in.

#### Subscribing with keyword arguments
---

You can use keyword arguments to create a subscription with any combination of parameters. At least one parameter is required.

Here's how:

1. Open the Microsoft Teams channel you want notifications in.
2. Run `@launchdarkly subscribe` and pass in any combination of the following arguments:
   - `-p` or `--project=`
   - `-e` or `--environment=`
   - `-f` or `--flag_key=`
   - `-s` or `--status=`
   - `-a` or `--action=`
   - `-t` or `--tag=`
3. Press **Enter**.

For example, the following command creates a subscription for all flags in the `qa` environment of the `chatbot` project, with status `active` and tag `production`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Example subscription with keyword arguments">

```bash
@launchdarkly subscribe -p chatbot -e qa -s active -t production
```

</CSTab>

</CodeSample>

### Subscribing with positional arguments
---

You can use positional arguments to create a subscription for a single flag. You must provide all three arguments.

Here's how:

1. Open the Slack channel you want notifications in.
2. Run `@launchdarkly subscribe` and provide in order the project, environment, and flag key of the flag you would like to subscribe to.
3. Press **Enter**.

For example, the following command creates a subscription for the `chat-response` flag in the `qa` environment of the `chatbot` project:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Example subscription with positional arguments">

```bash
@launchdarkly subscribe chatbot qa chat-response
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Managing subscriptions

You can view and remove subscriptions in a Teams channel using the `@launchdarkly list` command:

1. Open the Teams channel where you would like to remove notifications.
2. Type `@launchdarkly list` and press **Enter**. A list of subscriptions for the channel appears.
3. Locate the subscription you wish to remove from the channel.
4. Click **Delete**.

## Viewing flag change notifications in Microsoft Teams

Flag change notifications appear in the Microsoft Teams app. 

Here's how to view them:

1. In Microsoft Teams, open a chat window with LaunchDarkly.

- Click the flag name after "Feature flag:" to open the flag in LaunchDarkly.
- Click **View flag details** to view more information about the flag.
- Click **Unfollow changes** to stop receiving notifications for the flag. This will also unfollow the flag in LaunchDarkly.
