## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams incoming webhooks integration.

The Microsoft Teams incoming webhooks integration sends you alerts when the LaunchDarkly resources you care about, such as feature flags, projects, and account members, change. This notification appears in your Teams space.

## Setting up a Connector in Microsoft Teams

In order to add LaunchDarkly to a Teams workspace, you must configure an incoming webhook by setting up Connectors within Microsoft Teams. Then, you'll add the webhook URL to LaunchDarkly.

1. Log into Microsoft Teams.
2. Navigate to "Connectors."

2. Click **Add integration**. The "Create Microsoft Teams configuration" panel appears.
3. Paste your **Incoming webhook URL** into the field.
4. Set any filters for sending notifications to Teams by configuring a policy. LaunchDarkly sends all flag change events in the production environment to Teams by default. To learn more about creating a policy, read [Example policies and templates](/home/members/example-policies).
5. Save your configuration.

Now you are notified in your Teams workspace when someone updates a flag.
