## Overview

This topic explains how to toggle feature flags with the LaunchDarkly Slack app.

## Toggling flags on and off from Slack

You can turn flag targeting on or off from within Slack for debugging, and feature management, or use this as a feature kill switch.

To reach the toggle:
1. Either click the **View details** button on a flag change notification OR paste a link to the flag in Slack
2. Click the **...** overflow menu item in the flag details message

3. On the "Flag Overview" message, you have the ability to toggle the flag  by using **Toggle targeting off** or **Toggle targeting on**.

After you confirm changes, you will receive a notification stating that the flag targeting has changed.
