## Overview

This topic explains how to control feature flags with the LaunchDarkly Slack app.

## Toggling flags on and off from Slack

You can also turn flag targeting on / off from within Slack for debugging, and feature management, or use this as a feature kill switch.

To reach the toggle, click the **View details** button on a flag change notification or type `/launchdarkly flags` in your Slack client's text bar and click the **View details** overflow menu item.

On the "Flag Overview" message, you have the ability to toggle flags on or off by using **Toggle targeting off** or **Toggle targeting on**.

After you confirm changes, you will receive a notification stating that the flag targeting has changed.
