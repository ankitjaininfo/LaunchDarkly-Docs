## Overview

This topic explains how to use the Slack webhook integration to set up [Slack Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to receive any activities in LaunchDarkly. When you change something in LaunchDarkly, for example, when you update a feature flag or invite a new account member, LaunchDarkly sends an incoming webhook to Slack.

  <CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly has developed a [new Slack app](/integrations/slack) which is more powerful and easier to use than the Slack webhooks integration.

The content below describes the older webhook-based integration.

## Creating a Slack incoming hook

First, create an incoming hook in Slack. To do this, go to the [Incoming Webhooks](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/) page in Slack, select a channel, and click Add Incoming WebHooks integration.

Copy the Webhook URL, and in LaunchDarkly, navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/integrations), and click **+ Integration** in the chat integrations section.

## Adding a policy filter

LaunchDarkly sends all flag change events in the production environment to a webhook by default. To customize the events LaunchDarkly sends to your Slack room, use the policy editor in the webhook creation panel. To learn more about creating a policy, read [Example policies and templates](/home/members/example-policies).

For example, if you want to receive an event only when a change is made to one of your production feature flags, you can add the following policy to your room notification:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Policy">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/production:flag/*"]
  }
]
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Disabling a Slack incoming webhook

You can temporarily disable a Slack incoming webhook by clicking the **edit** icon and toggling the switch **Off** from the [Integrations](https://app.launchdarkly.com/integrations) page.
