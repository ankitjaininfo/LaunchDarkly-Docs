## Overview

This topic explains how to subscribe to flag notifications in Slack channels. You can receive notifications for when flags are created, updated, deleted, or ready for removal.

It can be useful to let an entire channel know when a flag changes or is ready to remove. You can subscribe Slack channels to notifications from individual flags or the entire set of flags associated with a filter as described in the previous topic.

To learn more about filter-based notifications, read [Adding flag filters to a channel](#adding-flag-filters-to-a-channel).

## Subscribing to flag notifications

When someone updates a flag, either directly in LaunchDarkly or through the Slack app, LaunchDarkly sends a notification of the change to any channel subscribed to updates for that flag. You can subscribe to individual flags within a Slack channel.

To subscribe to an individual flag:

1. In LaunchDarkly, open any tab of a feature flag. Copy the URL from your browser address bar.
2. Paste the URL into the Slack channel and press **Enter**. A flag overview message appears.
3. Click the **overflow menu**.

![The flag overview message with the overflow menu displayed.](slack-flag-overview-overflow.png)

4. Select "Add flag to channel." A confirmation message appears.

The channel is now subscribed to notifications about the flag.

Flag notifications include the following information:

- The name of the person who made the change
- The name of the flag
- The environment, project, and key of the flag
- A comment about the change, if applicable

To display additional information about the flag change, click **View details**.

Use `/launchdarkly flags` to view and manage flags associated with the current channel. To learn more, read [Listing flags in a channel](/integrations/slack/managing#listing-flags-in-a-channel).

## Subscribing to all flag notifications in a channel

You can subscribe a channel to all flag notifications to act as a changelog for flag activity in LaunchDarkly.

To subscribe a channel to all flag notifications:

1. Open the Slack channel where you wish notifications about all flags to appear.
2. Type `/launchdarkly subscribe` in your Slack client's text bar and press **Enter**. The "Build subscription" dialog appears.
4. Click **Apply filters**. The "Found Flags" dialog appears.
5. Click **Add filters to channel**. The channel receives a notification that flag notifications have been added to that channel.

If you want to subscribe to only certain flags within a channel, you can add a flag filter.

## Adding flag filters to a channel

You can add a flag filter to a Slack channel so the channel receive notifications only for those flags.

To add a flag filter to a channel:

1. Open the Slack channel where you wish notifications about a flag to appear.
2. Type `/launchdarkly subscribe` in your Slack client's text bar and press **Enter**. The "Build subscription" dialog appears.
3. Filter on the project, environment, flag key, status, action, or flag tags to narrow the scope of changes.
4. Click **Apply filters**. The "Found Flags" dialog appears.
5. Click **Add filters to channel**. The channel receives a notification that the filter has been added to that channel.

## Receiving alerts when flags are ready to remove

In the Slack app, you can subscribe to notifications when it’s time to remove flags from code. Removing from code is a necessary step before archiving flags.

Read about [deleting and archiving flags](/home/code/flag-archive) to learn how to keep your codebase clean. The Slack app makes it easy to receive notifications once flags are ready to remove.

You will get served a “ready to remove” notification when any flags that you subscribe to become “inactive” or “launched” in status code.

To set up a "ready to remove" flag alert:

1. Open the channel where you want to get notifications on flags that are ready to remove.
2. Type `/launchdarkly subscribe` and press **Enter**. The "Build subscription" dialog appears.
3. Filter on the project, environment, flag key, or flag tags where you want to be notified when flags have become "inactive" or "launched."
4. Click the the **Action** menu and select "Ready for removal."
5. Click **Apply filters**.
6. Click **Add filter to channel**. A Slack confirmation message appears.

The channel is now notified when flags included in your filter are ready to remove and archive.

## Removing flag notifications from a channel

You are able to remove flags from a channel so that you no longer receive notifications when the flag changes.

1. Open the Slack channel where you would like to remove notifications.
2. Type `/launchdarkly flags` and press **Enter**. A list of flags associated with the channel appears.
3. Locate the flag you wish to remove from the channel.
4. Select **Remove flag from channel** in the menu beside the name of the flag.
5. Once the subscription is removed, the entire channel receives a notification of the change.
