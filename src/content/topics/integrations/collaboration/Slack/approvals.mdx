## Overview

This topic explains how to manage approvals for flag changes using the Slack app. Approvals let you request review for changes you plan to make to a flag. You can view and act on approval requests from within the LaunchDarkly Slack app.

To use this feature, you must have installed and configured the LaunchDarkly Slack app. To learn more, read [Setting up the Slack app](/integrations/slack/setting-up?site=federal#setting-up-the-slack-app).

To learn more about approvals, read [Approvals](/home/feature-workflows/approvals).

## Viewing approvals in Slack

Here's how to create approval requests and view them with the Slack app:

1. In the LaunchDarkly user interface, navigate to a feature flag, and update the flag's targeting.
2. Request approval for your changes by clicking the **dropdown icon** on the 'Review and Save' or 'Save' button and choosing **Request approval**. For more details, read [Requesting approvals](/home/feature-workflows/approvals#requesting-approvals).
3. In Slack, click the new notification the LaunchDarkly app creates. The notification contains a link to the approval request.

Any reviewers that you added to the approval request also receive a Slack notification if they have authorized the LaunchDarkly app.

## Reviewing approvals in Slack

Here's how to manage approval requests that ask for your review:

1. Click the Slack notification that you receive from the LaunchDarkly app.
2. Click **Review** to create your review on the request.

3. Review the targeting changes, and then choose an action for your review.

- **Approve and apply changes**: Approve the changes and apply them immediately.
- **Approve changes**: Approve the changes without applying them. The original requester, or any account member with a Writer, Admin, Owner, or appropriate custom role can apply the changes you approved.
- **Decline changes**: Deny the changes.
- **Comment only**: Leave a comment on the requested flag changes.

5. Click **Submit** to submit your review.

## Viewing replies on approval requests in Slack

You receive threaded replies to the original approval request for each review others submit.

Here's how to view updates to the approval request:

1. Go to the LaunchDarkly app in your Slack account.
2. Click into a thread to view comments, approvals, and declines on the approval request.
