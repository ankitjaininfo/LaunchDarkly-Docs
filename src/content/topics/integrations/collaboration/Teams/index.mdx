## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams integration.

You can use the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams integration to receive notifications when LaunchDarkly resources change. For example, you can receive alerts when a feature flag changes, when a new approval is requested for changes to a feature flag, or when a new member joins your account. These notifications appear in your Teams space. You can also unfurl feature flag links in conversations.

The LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams integration lets you:

- Follow feature flags to receive notifications when they change.
- Receive notifications when a new approval is requested for changes to a feature flag.
- Unfurl feature flag links in conversations.
- Link messages in a public channel to a feature flag. Also known as [Flag Links](/home/flags/links).

To learn how to setup the app, read [Setting up Microsoft Teams integration](/integrations/microsoft-teams/setting-up).

## Getting help

The Microsoft Teams integration has a help menu that can give you details about what you can do, and it describes the commands that you can use to interact with the app.

To access the Help menu, open a chat window with LaunchDarkly, type `help` in the text bar, and press **Enter**. The LaunchDarkly help menu will appears with a list of available options.
