## Overview

This topic explains how flag links work in Microsoft Teams. A flag link being shared in any conversation can be unfurled to display a preview of the flag. Flag links being shared in public channels will also be automatically registered within LaunchDarkly. The LaunchDarkly app can also be used to manually link conversations in public channels to a flag.

To use this feature, you must have installed and configured the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams app. To learn more, read [Setting up the Microsoft Teams app](/integrations/microsoft-teams/setting-up).

## Unfurling flag and segment links

When you paste a flag link in a public channel, the LaunchDarkly app unfurls the flag link to display a preview of the flag:

When a flag link is unfurled in Microsoft Teams, LaunchDarkly saves the message on the flag's **Links** tab. This helps track conversations about flags and provide up-to-date information on the flag's usage. To learn more, read [Flag links](/home/flags/links).

## Manually linking chat messages to a flag

You can manually link a chat message to a feature flag. This is useful if you want to link a chat message to a flag when a link has not been pasted.

To manually link a chat message to a flag:

1. In Microsoft Teams, navigate to a public channel.
2. Click the three-dot **expand icon** next to a message and choose **More actions**.
3. Click **Create flag link**.

4. A modal will appear to link the message to a flag. Select project by typing into the project field. Click **Select project** to continue.
5. Select a flag by typing into the flag field.
6. Click **Create** to finish linking the message.
