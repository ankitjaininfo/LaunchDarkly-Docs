## Overview

This topic explains how flag links work in Microsoft Teams. You can unfurl flag links in Microsoft Teams to display a preview of the flag. You can manually create a flag link to a chat message in Microsoft Teams. These features are only available in public channels.

To use this feature, you must have installed and configured the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams app. To learn more, read [Setting up the Microsoft Teams app](/integrations/microsoft-teams/setting-up).

## Unfurling flag and segment links

When you paste a flag link in a public channel, the LaunchDarkly app unfurls the flag link to display a preview of the flag.

When a flag link is unfurled in Microsoft Teams, the message will be saved within LaunchDarkly. These saved messages can be viewed in the LaunchDarkly user interface. This is a great way to keep track of conversations about flags to provide up to date context on it's usage. To learn more about flag links, read [Flag links](/home/flags/links).

## Manually linking chat messages to a flag

You can manually link a chat message to a feature flag. This is useful if you want to link a chat message to a flag when a link has not been pasted. To manually link a chat message to a flag, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Teams, navigate to a public channel.
2. Click the three-dot **expand icon** next to a message, choose **More actions**, and click **Create flag link**.
