## Overview

This topic explains how flag links work in Microsoft Teams. A flag link being shared in any conversation can be unfurled to display a preview of the flag. Flag links being shared in public channels will also be automatically registered within LaunchDarkly. The LaunchDarkly app can also be used to manually link conversations in public channels to a flag.

To use this feature, you must have installed and configured the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams app. To learn more, read [Setting up the Microsoft Teams app](/integrations/microsoft-teams/setting-up).

## Unfurling flag and segment links

When a flag or segment link is pasted in a public channel, the LaunchDarkly app unfurls the link to display a preview of the resource:

When a flag link is unfurled in Microsoft Teams, LaunchDarkly saves the message on the flag's **Links** tab. This helps track conversations about flags and provide up-to-date information on the flag's usage. To learn more, read [Flag links](/home/flags/links).

## Manually linking chat messages to a flag

Feature flags can be manually linked to a chat message in a public channel.

To manually link a chat message to a flag:

1. In Microsoft Teams, navigate to a public channel.
2. Click the three-dot **expand icon** next to a message and choose **More actions**.
3. Click **Create flag link**.
