## Overview

This topic explains how approval notifications are displayed in Microsoft Teams. Approvals let you request review for changes you plan to make to a flag. You can view approval requests from within the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams app.

To use this feature, you must have installed and configured the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams app. To learn more, read [Setting up the Microsoft Teams app](/integrations/microsoft-teams/setting-up).

To learn more about approvals, read [Approvals](/home/feature-workflows/approvals).

## Viewing approvals in Microsoft Teams

Here's how to create approval requests and view them with the Microsoft Teams app:

1. In the LaunchDarkly user interface, navigate to a feature flag, and update the flag's targeting.
2. Request approval for your changes by clicking the **dropdown icon** on the 'Review and Save' or 'Save' button and choosing **Request approval**. For more details, read [Requesting approvals](/home/feature-workflows/approvals#requesting-approvals).
3. In Microsoft Teams, click the new notification the LaunchDarkly app creates. Click **Open in LaunchDarkly** to view the flag details in the LaunchDarkly user interface.

Any reviewers that you added to the approval request also receive a Microsoft Teams notification if they have authorized the LaunchDarkly app.
