## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly Grafana integration. You can use the integration to send flag, environment, and project updates to Grafana as annotations to add context to your graphs.

## Prerequisites

To use the Grafana integration, you must have the following prerequisites:

- A Grafana instance that is accessible to LaunchDarkly's servers.
- An Grafana [service account](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/service-accounts/#service-accounts) with the "Annotation writer" role and a corresponding service account token.

To create a Grafana service account and generate a service account token:

1. In Grafana, open the the **Administration** menu and select "Service accounts." The "Service accounts" tab appears.

![The "Service accounts" tab in Grafana.](grafana-service-accounts-tab.png)

2. Click **Add service account**. The "Create service account" page appears.
3. Enter a **Display name**.
4. Change the **Role** selection to "Annotation writer."

5. Click **Create**. The "Service token" page appears.
6. Click **Add service account token**.

![An example "Service token" page with the mouse cursor hovering over the "Add service account token" button.](grafana-service-token-page.png)

7. Enter a **Display name** for the token.
8. Click **Generate token**.
9. Copy the token and save if somewhere secure. Grafana displays this token only once, so you must copy and store it now. You will use it to set up the Grafana integration in LaunchDarkly.

## Setting up the Grafana integration

After you create a service account token in Grafana, you can set up the integration in LaunchDarkly.

1. Navigate to the [**Integrations** page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations) and find "Grafana."
2. Click **Add integration**. The "Create Grafana configuration" panel appears.
3. (Optional) Give your integration a human-readable **Name**.
4. Enter your Grafana instance URL. Do not include a trailing `/`.
5. Enter the Grafana **service account token**. You created this token in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
6. (Optional) Configure a custom policy to control which events LaunchDarkly sends to Grafana. To learn more, read [Filtering the events you send to Grafana](#filtering-the-events-you-send-to-grafana).

![The "Create Grafana integration" panel.](grafana-config.png)

7. After reading the Integration Terms and Conditions, check the **I have read and agree to the Integration Terms and Conditions** checkbox.
8. Click **Save configuration**. The new integration appears on the **Integrations** page. It is switched **On** by default.

After you set up the Grafana integration, events from LaunchDarkly appear in your Grafana dashboard.

## Filtering the events you send to Grafana

By default, LaunchDarkly sends events to Grafana for changes made to any feature flag, environment, or project. If you have a more limited use case for using the integration, or you wish to restrict which data you send to Grafana, you can filter which events LaunchDarkly sends.

To filter events, write a policy using the same syntax as the custom roles feature to filter the events sent to Grafana.

For more information about writing policies, read [Policies in custom roles](/home/members/role-policies).

For example, if you only want to receive an event when a change is made to one of the feature flags in your testing environment, you can add the following policy to your events stream:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Example Grafana policy">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/your-test-environment:flag/*"]
  }
]
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To add a custom filter:

1. Navigate to the [**Integrations** page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations) and find "Grafana."
2. Find the configuration you wish to modify, and click the **overflow menu**. The "Edit Grafana configuration" panel appears.

![Grafana integrations with the "Edit integration configuration" option called out.](grafana-edit-callout.png)

3. Click **Advanced editor**. The Advanced editor appears.
4. Enter your custom **policy**.

![The "Edit Grafana configuration" panel with the Advanced editor open and a policy inside it.](grafana-custom-policy.png)<br/>

5. Click **Save configuration**.

You can verify that LaunchDarkly is sending a customized set of events by viewing the events in your Grafana dashboard.

## Adding LaunchDarkly annotations to Grafana dashboards

To add LaunchDarkly events as annotations in Grafana dashboards:

1. Open the Grafana dashboard in edit mode.
2. Click the **Dashboard settings** gear icon button located at the top of the page.
3. Click **Annotations**.
4. Click **New query**. The "New annotation" page appears.
5. Enter a human readable name for the annotation, such as "LaunchDarkly feature flags."
6. Change the **Data source** select menu to "-- Grafana --".
7. Change the **Filter by** select menu to "Tags".

8. The LaunchDarkly integration sends annotation events to Grafana with event-specific tags. You can use one or more of the following tags to filter the annotations that appear on your dashboard:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Tag</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`launchdarkly`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>This tag is added to all LaunchDarkly annotation events.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`ld_tag:TAG`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The LaunchDarkly tag associated with the resource that changed. For example, if a feature flag has the tag
        `grafana` in LaunchDarky, all event annotations associated with that flag will be sent to Grafana with the tag
        `ld_tag:grafana`.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`project_key:PROJECT_KEY`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The LaunchDarkly project key that is associated with the change event.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`environment_key:ENVIRONMENT_KEY`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The LaunchDarkly environment key that is associated with the change event.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`flag_key:FLAG_KEY`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The LaunchDarkly feature flag key that is associated with the change event. This tag is only applied to feature
        flag change events.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`segment_key:SEGMENT_KEY`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The LaunchDarkly segment flag key that is associated with the change event. This tag is only applied to segment
        change events.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`kind:RESOURCE_KIND`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The resource kind associated with the change event where `RESOURCE_KIND` is one of `flag`, `segment`, `project`,
        `environment`, or `member`.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

9. Click **Apply**.
