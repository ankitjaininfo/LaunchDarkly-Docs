## Overview

This topic explains how to use the feature stores integration framework capability.

## Using feature stores

Feature stores let LaunchDarkly write feature flag data to a given provider. To learn more, read [Persistent data stores](/sdk/concepts/data-stores).

The feature store capability lets you to specify an endpoint that can receive a payload containing up-to-date flag data from LaunchDarkly.

In addition to `formVariables`, the `featureStore` has two properties:

- [`featureStoreRequest`](#the-feature-store-request-property)
- (optional) [`validationRequest`](#the-validation-request-property)

To learn more about form variables, read [Using form variables](/integrations/partner-integrations/form-variables).

### The feature store request property

This specifies the request `endpoint` that LaunchDarkly makes when flag data are updated. You can do this using an `endpoint` and a `parser`. To learn more, read [Endpoints](/integrations/partner-integrations/endpoints).

In addition to the form variables defined in your manifest, you can use the special variable `_featureStoreKey`. `_featureStoreKey` is provided by LaunchDarkly, and is unique per environment.

### The validation request property

Specifying an optional validation request lets members to verify that they have properly filled out the details to correctly make a request.

The `parser` object lets LaunchDarkly interpret the response of the validation request. It allows a mapping of success and errors for the given response body of the request in the form of a [JSON pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901). The `parser` object has two properties: a required `success` and an optional `error`.

Here is an example `parse` object:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="A parse object">

```json
    "parser": {
      "success": "/success",
      "error": "/error"
    },
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Choose an endpoint with a response that will indicate that the specified form variables are correct, but has no side effects.

Here is an example `featureStore` capability:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label='The featureStore capability'>

```json
    "featureStoreRequest": {
      "endpoint": {
        "url": "https://example.com/{{accountId}}/dictionary/{{dictId}}/item/{{_featureStoreKey}}",
        "method": "PUT",
        "headers": [
          {
            "name": "Authorization",
            "value": "Bearer {{apiToken}}"
          },
          {
            "name": "Content-Type",
            "value": "text/plain"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "validationRequest": {
      "endpoint": {
        "url": "https://example.com/{{accountId}}/dictionary/{{dictId}}/items",
        "method": "GET",
        "headers": [
          {
            "name": "Authorization",
            "value": "Bearer {{apiToken}}"
          }
        ]
      },
      "parser": {
        "success": "/success"
      }
    }
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
