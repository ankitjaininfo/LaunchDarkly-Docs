## Overview

This topic explains how to use the reserved custom properties integration framework capability.

## Using reserved custom properties

Custom properties let you store data in LaunchDarkly alongside a feature flag. For example, you can use custom properties to indicate flag-level associations with data on your service. If you don't have any flag-level associations or configurations, you don't need to use this capability.

To learn more, read [Custom properties](/home/connecting/custom-properties).

By default, members must specify a custom property name and key when they attach the custom property value to a feature flag. This step introduces the possibility of user error. To prevent this, developers can "reserve" a custom property for their integration, which makes it much easier for members to correctly add the property's value to feature flags.

`reservedCustomProperties` require a `name` and `key`. Adding a `description` is optional.

After a member configures your integration, the custom property appears in the dropdown on the flag's **Settings** page.

For example, the [Datadog integration](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/blob/main/integrations/datadog/manifest.json) uses the following `reservedCustomProperties`:

<CodeSample>

```json
    "reservedCustomProperties": [
      {
        "name": "Datadog tags",
        "description": "Tags are a way of adding additional dimension...",
        "key": "datadog"
      }
    ]
```
