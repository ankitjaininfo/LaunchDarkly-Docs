## Overview

This topic explains how to build a LaunchDarkly integration as part of our partner program. You can join our Technology Partner Program to make your integrations publicly available.

## Onboarding with LaunchDarkly

Our Technology Partner Program empowers technology partners to build, launch, and go-to-market with LaunchDarkly. Benefits include partnership support, early product access, and joint marketing opportunities, among others.

To get started, visit our [Partners page](https://launchdarkly.com/partners).

## Audience Reach

We list partner integrations in the following locations:

* [The Integrations page of the LaunchDarkly application](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations)
* [The LaunchDarkly website](https://launchdarkly.com/integrations)
* [Our Integrations documentation](/integrations) for configuration and implementation documentation

You can also list your integration on your own websites and platforms.

## Planning your integration

After you have completed the partner agreement, you can begin planning your integration.

As you plan, you may want to consider the following questions:

- What value will your integration provide to your integration's users?
- How will you measure your integration's success?
- What is your plan your ongoing support of the integration?
- How will you document the integration?

## Connecting your platform to LaunchDarkly

Next, decide how to connect your integration to LaunchDarkly. You can allow members to authenticate using an OAuth application or using API access tokens.

### Authenticating using an OAuth application

LaunchDarkly must verify OAuth applications before customers can use them. OAuth also lets you limit the connection of your integrated app to individual members. To learn how, read [OAuth applications](/home/connecting/oauth).

### Authenticating using API access tokens

We provide two types of API access tokens:

- [Personal access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens#personal-tokens)
- [Service tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens#service-tokens)

If you use API access tokens for authentication, we recommend using built-in or custom roles to limit the amount of access to LaunchDarkly those tokens have. If you don't use custom roles to limit API token access, your members will be able to edit everything in your LaunchDarkly account, which can be a security risk.

<CalloutDescription>

As a best practice, we recommend giving your tokens the smallest scope required for your integration. For example, if your integration is not designed to modify your Production environment, use a custom role or inline policy to restrict access appropriately.

To learn how to use custom roles to limit access for an API tokens, read [Scoping personal API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens#scoping-personal-api-access-tokens).

We also recommend storing your API access tokens securely.

## Choosing an integration option

If your integration is only interacting with LaunchDarkly resources, you may be able to build it entirely using the REST API. If you require a more complex integration, such as one with triggers or flag links, use the integration framework.

We require an integration framework update for any published integration. LaunchDarkly uses the `manifest.json` and associated image resources to surface your integration to end users.

### Using the API

LaunchDarkly is built using an open REST API. Your integration can interact with LaunchDarkly in many of the same ways that you can through the user interface (UI). To learn how, read our [API documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/).

### Using the integration framework

LaunchDarkly's integration framework lets you build deeper integrations between LaunchDarkly and a third-party service.

A number of capabilities exist to provide integrations in both directions, such as sending partner-defined webhooks to third-party services or surfacing external feature flag-related links in the LaunchDarkly UI.

These capabilities are further outlined in the section below.

## Understanding integration capabilities

Your integration's capabilities are how it interacts with LaunchDarkly.

LaunchDarkly supports the following integration capabilities:

- [Audit log events hook](/integrations/partner-integrations/capabilities#audit-log-events-hook)
- [Triggers](/integrations/partner-integrations/capabilities#triggers)
- [Flag links](/integrations/partner-integrations/capabilities#flag-links)
- [Reserved custom properties](/integrations/partner-integrations/capabilities#reserved-custom-properties)
- [Feature stores](/integrations/partner-integrations/capabilities#feature-stores)
