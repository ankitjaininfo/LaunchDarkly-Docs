## Overview

This topic explains the LaunchDarkly Dynatrace integrations available, including events and triggers.

[Dynatrace](https://dynatrace.com/) is an infrastructure monitoring platform that offers [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) and automated problem remediation.

## Events

The LaunchDarkly Dynatrace integration makes it easier to diagnose problems by sending flag change events to Dynatrace. To learn how, read [Using the Dynatrace events integration](/integrations/dynatrace/events).

## Triggers

LaunchDarkly supports using flag triggers with Dynatrace. You can use flag triggers to automate flag changes. For example, you can create an alert in Dynatrace that uses a LaunchDarkly trigger to toggle a flag on or off when Dynatrace triggers a predefined or custom event. To learn how, read [Using flag triggers with Dynatrace](/integrations/dynatrace/triggers).

## Cloud Automation

This integration allows LaunchDarkly customers to configure Dynatrace Cloud Automation to automatically enable or disable feature flags to remediate problems when specific operational health thresholds or alerts are triggered as part of software delivery lifecycle and testing.
