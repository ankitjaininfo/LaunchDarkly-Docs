## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's trigger feature with Datadog. For example, you can create an alert in Datadog that toggles a flag on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold.

We recommend using flag triggers for Datadog alerts only, not recovery alerts. If you connect a trigger to recovery alerts, the trigger activates on recovery as well as on alert.

To learn more about configuring your webhook without recovery alerts, read [Connecting the webhook to a Datadog event](#connecting-the-webhook-to-a-datadog-event).

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this topic, you must meet the following prerequisites.

- You must have a feature flag with a trigger. To learn more about creating triggers, read [Creating a new flag trigger](/home/feature-workflows/triggers#creating-a-new-flag-trigger).
- You must have access to the trigger's URL, which you copied and saved during the trigger creation process. To learn more, read [Understanding flag triggers' security](/home/feature-workflows/triggers#understanding-flag-triggers-security).
- You must have an existing [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) account.

## Connecting a flag trigger to Datadog

Connecting a LaunchDarkly trigger to Datadog takes two steps.

You must:

1. Create a webhook in Datadog that includes a custom JSON template with your trigger URL, and
2. Connect that webhook to a Datadog alert.

### Setting up a JSON template in Datadog

First you must configure a JSON template to use the LaunchDarkly trigger.

To configure the template:

1. Log in to Datadog.
2. Navigate to **Integrations** and search for the **Webhooks** section.
3. Create a new webhook based on the **Installation** instructions and paste the LaunchDarkly trigger URL into the URL field.
4. Copy this Datadog payload into the configuration field in Datadog:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JSON">

```json
{
  "title": "$EVENT_TITLE",
  "url": "$LINK"
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>You must customize the payload to view trigger details in LaunchDarkly</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The only payload keys LaunchDarkly processes are `title` and `url`. Any other fields you put in the payload do not appear in LaunchDarkly.

If you use a different JSON template than the one provided above, you must include the `title` and `url` fields or the trigger will not save useful data about the event in the flag's auditlog. The `url` is the URl of your Datadog event.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

5. Click **Save**.

### Connecting the webhook to a Datadog event

After you create the webhook in Datadog, you must connect it to an event in order for the LaunchDarkly trigger to perform actions on the flag.

1. Navigate to **Monitors**.
2. Choose the **Alert** you wish to connect to the trigger and add the webhook you created earlier to that alert.

If you don't want Datadog to trigger when the alert recovers, wrap the webhook in the following template expression:

 <CodeSample>
 <CSTab label="Expression">

```json
`{{#is_alert}} @webhook-<YOUR_WEBHOOK_NAME> {{/is_alert}}`
```

 </CSTab>
 </CodeSample>

3. Click **Save.**
4. In the Datadog metric alert you want to activate the flag trigger, add `@webhook-<YOUR_WEBHOOK_NAME>`.

## Testing the trigger configuration

After you create a trigger in Datadog, you can verify that it has connected to LaunchDarkly correctly.

To test the trigger:

1. Navigate to Datadog and find the metric alert to which you added the webhook.
2. Click **Test Notifications** at the bottom of the page.
3. Select any single notification and click **Run Test**. This sends a test event to LaunchDarkly.
4. Navigate back to the flag's **Settings** page in LaunchDarkly.
5. Click the **overflow menu** on your LaunchDarkly trigger to confirm that the execution count has incremented. Sending a test notification does not trigger the flag action, so don't worry that you might toggle a flag by testing the configuration.

Your configuration details may vary based on your requirements.
