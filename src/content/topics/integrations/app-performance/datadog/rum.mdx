## Overview

This topic links to Datadog's documentation for its LaunchDarkly Real User Monitoring (RUM) integration. Datadog is an observability service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. 

You can send feature flag evaluation data from the LaunchDarkly [JavaScript SDK](/sdk/client-side/javascript) to Datadog as event properties.

To learn more, read Datadog's [Getting Started with Feature Flag Data in RUM documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/setup-feature-flag-data-collection/#launchdarkly-integration).

For an example of instrumenting a RUM application, read Datadog's guide [Remotely configure RUM using LaunchDarkly](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/remotely-configure-rum-using-launchdarkly/).
