## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's Vercel integration. This integration enables flag evaluation within Vercel Edge Workers or Vercel Edge Middleware. The integration writes the latest flag data from the configured environment directly to a Vercel Edge Config in your account. It also sends any change to a flag or segment configuration in your selected environment to your Vercel Edge Config, ensuring your Edge Config is always up to date.

Vercel enforces size limits on Edge Config values. Based on these limits, Vercel Enterprise customers and Vercel Pro customers with moderately-sized environments are likely to benefit the most from this integration. To learn more, read Vercel's documentation on [Edge Config Limits and pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/edge-config-limits#limits).

  <CalloutTitle>This integration requires LaunchDarkly's Vercel SDK</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

You can use the Vercel integration to bootstrap your application with the latest client-side feature flags. This eliminates the initial remote call to LaunchDarkly, providing zero-latency client-side feature flags with no flash of original content or shift in content layout. The Vercel integration also enables flag evaluations within Vercel Edge Middleware and Vercel Edge Workers. This means you can use your LaunchDarkly flags without an added latency from network requests.
