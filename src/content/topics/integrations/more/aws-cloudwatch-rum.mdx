## Overview

This topic explains how to set up and use the LaunchDarkly AWS CloudWatch RUM integration. With AWS CloudWatch RUM, you can perform real user monitoring to collect and view client-side data about your web application performance from actual user sessions in near real-time.

Read the [send custom events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-custom-events.html) CloudWatch documentation for more information on how to enable custom events for your app monitor.

## Setting up the integration

The code below can be modified to fit your setup.

Here's how to get started:

* Install and [configure the AWS CloudWatch RUM client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-get-started.html)
* Use the `recordEvent` API to send the evaluated flags to [CloudWatch RUM using custom events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-custom-events.html)

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Inspector Setup', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
inspectors: [
	{
		type: 'flag-used',
		name: 'cloudwatch-rum',
		method: (key, detail) => {
			const flagEvent = {
			flagKey: key,
			value: detail.value
			}
			if (detail.variationIndex) {
			flagEvent["variationIndex"] = detail.variationIndex
			}
			if (detail.reason) {
			flagEvent["reason"] = detail.reason
			}

			awsRum.recordEvent('com.launchdarkly.flag.evaluation', flagEvent)
		}
	}
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
