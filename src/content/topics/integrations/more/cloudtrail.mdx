## Overview

This topic explains how to configure and use CloudTrail Lake integration for LaunchDarkly.

The CloudTrail Lake integration lets you configure [CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) to receive any activity from LaunchDarkly and then store data in a [CloudTrail Lake](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-lake.html). When something changes, such as a feature flag updates or a new account member is added to LaunchDarkly, LaunchDarkly sends an event to CloudTrail. 

In a few steps, you can consolidate your LaunchDarkly activity events together with AWS activity events in CloudTrail without having to build or manage the event data pipeline.

## Setting up the CloudTrail integration in LaunchDarkly

To connect CloudTrail Lake to LaunchDarkly, you need to configure the LaunchDarkly CloudTrail Lake integration to send events to a CloudTrail Channel to be stored in a CloudTrail Lake.

To configure the integration:

1. Navigate to the [**Integrations** page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations) and find "AWS CloudTrail Lake."
2. Click **Add integration**. The "Create AWS CloudTrail Lake configuration" panel appears.
3. (Optional) Give your integration a human-readable **Name**.
4. Click on the auto generated **External Id** value to copy it. 
5. Navigate to [Configuring LaunchDarkly integration in AWS](#configuring-launchdarkly-integration-in-aws) section in this documentation and follow the steps to create a "Channel ARN" with the external ID.
6. Enter the channel ARN into the **Channel ARN** field. You created this channel ARN in the previous step.
7. (Optional) Configure a custom policy to control which events LaunchDarkly sends to CloudTrail. To learn more, read [Filtering the events you send to CloudTrail](#filtering-the-events-you-send-to-cloudtrail).

<br />

8. After reading the Integration Terms and Conditions, check the **I have read and agree to the Integration Terms and Conditions** checkbox.
9. Click **Save configuration**. 

The new integration appears on the Integrations page. It is switched **On** by default.

9. Follow the steps outlined in the [setting up the CloudTrail integration in LaunchDarkly](#setting-up-the-cloudtrail-integration-in-launchdarkly) section to complete your setup.

For detailed instructions on how to set up CloudTrail, read the [AWS CloudTrail documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html).

## Filtering the events you send to CloudTrail

By default, LaunchDarkly sends events to CloudTrail for changes made to any feature flag in a production environment. If you have a more limited use case, or you wish to expand or restrict which data you send to CloudTrail, you can filter which events LaunchDarkly sends.

To filter events, write a policy using the same syntax as the custom roles feature to filter the events sent to CloudTrail.

For more information about writing policies, read [Policies in custom roles](/home/members/role-policies).

For example, if you only want to receive an event when a change is made to one of the feature flags in your testing environment, you can add the following policy to your events stream:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Example CloudTrail policy">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/your-test-environment:flag/*"]
  }
]
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To add a custom filter:

1. Navigate to the [**Integrations** page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations).
2. Find the integration you wish to modify and click **Edit integration configuration**. The "Edit AWS CloudTrail Lake configuration" panel appears.

![The "AWS CloudTrail Lake" section with the "Edit integration configuration" option called out.](cloudtrail-integration-edit-callout.png)

3. Click **Advanced editor**. The Advanced editor appears.
4. Enter your custom policy.

![The "Edit AWS CloudTrail Lake configuration" panel with the Advanced editor open and a policy inside it.](cloudtrail-custom-policy.png)

5. Click **Save configuration**.
6. Verify that LaunchDarkly is sending a customized set of events by viewing the events in CloudTrail Lake.
