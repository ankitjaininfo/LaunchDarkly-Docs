## Overview

This topic explains how to set up and use the LaunchDarkly Zendesk integration.

The LaunchDarkly Zendesk app gives you a read-only view of your feature flags. You can view the flag variations LaunchDarkly serves to your customers without leaving Zendesk. This is useful for customer success and support teams working with customers to debug issues or access new features.

### Installing the LaunchDarkly application from Zendesk Marketplace

1. Navigate to the [LaunchDarkly listing on the Zendesk Marketplace](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/474556/launchdarkly).
2. Click **Install**. A popup appears.
3. Select the Zendesk account you would like to install the LaunchDarkly integration to and click **Install**.

### Configuring the context key and context kind fields

You can configure Zendesk custom User Fields and custom Organization Fields to correspond to LaunchDarkly context keys and kinds.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Zendesk does not support multi-contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Zendesk only supports displaying variations for contexts with one context kind. To learn more about single and multi-contexts, read [Contexts and segments](/home/contexts).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To display the specific flag variations served to a given Zendesk user, configure Zendesk custom User Fields to correspond to LaunchDarkly context keys and/or context kinds. Alternatively, if you target feature flags based on organizations rather than individual end users, configure Zendesk custom Organization Fields to correspond to LaunchDarkly context keys and/or context kinds.

To add a Zendesk custom User Field:

1. Click the **Admin gear icon**.
2. Under "Manage", select **User Fields**:

![The Admin screen with the User Fields menu item out.](zendesk-manage-user-fields-callout.png)

3. Select the **Text** custom field type on the right and drag it to the active fields area. Alternatively, click the **plus icon ( + )** beside the "Text" field type, then drag and drop the field into the order you would like it to appear in each User profile.
4. Enter a "Field title" shown to agents and a "Field key" in the "Properties" panel. These can be anything you want, but they should be descriptive enough for your agents to recognize them as LaunchDarkly context keys or context kinds. Save the field key for the next section.
5. Click **Create field**. The field now shows on all Zendesk user profiles.

To add a Zendesk custom Organization Field:

1. Click the **Admin gear icon**.
2. Under "Manage", select **Organization Fields**.
3. Select the **Text** custom field type on the right and drag it to the active fields area. Alternatively, click the **plus icon ( + )** beside the "Text" field type, then drag and drop the field into the order you would like it to appear in each Organization profile.
4. Enter a "Field title" shown to agents and a "Field key" in the "Properties" panel. These can be anything you want, but they should be descriptive enough for your agents to recognize them as LaunchDarkly context keys or context kinds. Save the field key for the next section.
5. Click **Create field**. The field now shows on all Zendesk organization profiles.

To learn more, read the [Zendesk documentation on custom field types](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203661866-About-custom-field-types).

### Configuring your LaunchDarkly application

2. Under "Apps", select **Manage**.
3. Select the LaunchDarkly application:

![The LaunchDarkly application configuration page in Zendesk, configured with sample settings.](zendesk-app-configuration.png)

4. Enter the LaunchDarkly project and environment keys that you want to view customers' flag variations for.
5. Add any optional tags you would like to use to filter the feature flags displayed.
6. If you added the LaunchDarkly context key as a custom Organization field, check the box next to "LaunchDarkly user key is an Organization field." Otherwise, leave it blank.
7. Enter the field key you defined in step 4 of the previous section into the LaunchDarkly context key field.
8. Select whether or not you would like to enable role or group restrictions.
9. Under "OAuth Authentication", click **Authorize with LaunchDarkly**. A new tab appears.
10. Click **Authorize**. You are returned to the integration configuration page.
11. Click **Update** to save your settings.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some errors you may encounter and suggested solutions:

### There is a warning icon next to the Variation header

The warning ⚠️ icon next to the "Variation" header on the flag table indicates that LaunchDarkly has not observed any flag evaluations for this user in the past 30 days.

Unless the user is new or inactive, you may have entered an incorrect value in the **User key** field. You can find context keys on the **Contexts** list in the **Key** column. To learn more, read [The Contexts list](/home/contexts/contexts-list).

### "Error: LaunchDarkly user key not found"

This error indicates that the **User key field** has been incorrectly configured. Review the [Configuring the context key and context kind fields](#configuring-the-context-key-and-context-kind-fields) section to ensure you have set it up correctly and that it is populated on the Zendesk User profile associated with the ticket you are viewing.
