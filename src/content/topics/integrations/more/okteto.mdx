## Overview

This topic links to Okteto's documentation for its LaunchDarkly integration.

Okteto environments are isolated and reproducible environments that, when integrated with LaunchDarkly, let you test and validate your features before they reach production. The Okteto integration lets you automatically create a LaunchDarkly environment every time your team creates an Okteto development or preview environment.

Okteto manages this integration. To learn how to use it, read [Okteto's LaunchDarkly integration](https://github.com/okteto/launchdarkly).
