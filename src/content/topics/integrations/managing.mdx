## Overview

This topic explains how to manage push-based LaunchDarkly integrations. In a push-based integration, LaunchDarkly delivers events to the third-party integration through an integration service and logs whether the integration's configuration successfully received the event.

LaunchDarkly provides several tools to help set up and maintain push-based integrations, including status tables, error logs, and connection validation tests.

These tools are available for the following integrations:

- [AppDynamics](/integrations/appdynamics)
- [Datadog events](/integrations/datadog/events)
- [Dynatrace events](/integrations/dynatrace/events)
- [Elastic (ELK) Stack](/integrations/elastic-stack)
- [Honeycomb events](/integrations/honeycomb/events)
- [New Relic One events](/integrations/new-relic/events)
- [Microsoft Teams](/integrations/microsoft-teams)
- [SignalFX events](/integrations/signalfx/events)
- [Splunk](/integrations/splunk)

## Checking configuration statuses

LaunchDarkly provides a status table on the **Integrations** page for each push-based integration's configuration. The status table provides information about event successes and failures.

To view the status table, click the **expand arrows** next to the **Add integration** button for the integration you want to view:

The status table contains the following information:

- **Success events**: The total number of events LaunchDarkly successfully delivered since you created the integration configuration.
- **Most recent success**: How long ago LaunchDarkly delivered the last successful event.
- **Errors**: The total number of errors LaunchDarkly received from integration events since you created the integration configuration.
- **Most recent error**: How long ago LaunchDarkly received the most recent error. Click the link in this column to view the configuration's error log.

## Reading the error log

The error log shows a list of the most recent errors a given integration configuration has received.

To read an error log, click the link in the "Most recent error" column of a configuration's status table:

Error log entries contain the following information:

- **Status code**: The HTTP status code returned by the integration service.
- **Response body**: The HTTP response body returned by the integration service.
- **Event timestamp**: The timestamp when the error occurred. Your web browser determines the timezone.

Here is an image of the error log:

## Validating connections

After configuring an integration, you can test the connection to LaunchDarkly from the **Integrations** page.

To test a connection:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page.
2. Find the integration you want to validate from the "Integrations" list.
3. Click the **expand arrows** next to the **Add integration** button. The list of configurations for that integration appears.
4. Click the **overflow menu** next to the configuration you want to test.
5. Click **Edit integration configuration**:

  The "Edit configuration" panel appears.

6. Click **Validate Connection**.
  - If your connection is valid and LaunchDarkly delivered the test event successfully, then a success message appears.
  - If your connection is not valid and LaunchDarkly could not deliver the test event successfully, then an error message appears with an HTTP status code:
