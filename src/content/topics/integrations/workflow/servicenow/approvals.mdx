## Requesting approval for flag changes in ServiceNow

To request approval for flag changes in ServiceNow, you must request approval for the change in LaunchDarkly.

To request approval in LaunchDarkly:

1. In LaunchDarkly, navigate to the feature flag that you wish to change and make your needed changes to the flag targeting, status, or variations.
2. Click the **dropdown icon** in the **Review and save** button.
3. Select **Request Approval**. A dialog appears.
4. Enter the description and any scheduling details, if desired.
5. Click **Request Approval**. This creates a change request with state "New" in your ServiceNow instance.

6. The approvers for feature flag changes receive a notification.

## Viewing and approving approval requests in ServiceNow

The approver for a flag change can view and, if using manual approvals, approve the request in ServiceNow.

To access the change request in ServiceNow:

1. In LaunchDarkly, click the **clock** icon on the flag **Targeting** tab. A "Pending changes" panel appears.
2. Next to the request you want to view, click **View**. The "Review request" screen appears.
3. Click "Review in ServiceNow":

4. View or approve the request in ServiceNow. When the ServiceNow approval conditions are met, ServiceNow changes the state to "Implement." 
  - Alternatively, if ServiceNow changes the state to "Canceled," LaunchDarkly changes the approval request status to "Declined." 
5. Apply the approved flag changes within LaunchDarkly by clicking **Apply Changes** in the "Pending changes" panel. The ServiceNow change request state changes to "Review."

If you delete the approval request in LaunchDarkly, the ServiceNow change request state changes to "Canceled."

LaunchDarkly uses ServiceNow state values to from their APIs to determine if a change has been approved or denied in ServiceNow. To learn more, search for "State model and transitions" in [ServiceNow's documentation](https://docs.servicenow.com/) and choose the article for your ServiceNow version.

Here is a table explaining the standard ServiceNow states and the equivalent LaunchDarkly approval statuses:
