<CalloutTitle>The Jira Cloud integration is a Pro and Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Jira Cloud integration is available to customers on a Pro or Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

## Overview

This topic explains how LaunchDarkly's Jira Cloud integration allows you to link your feature flags to your team's Jira issues. When you connect a feature flag to a Jira issue, LaunchDarkly automatically creates a Jira flag link. To learn more, read [Flag links](/home/flags/links).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>This integration is for Jira Cloud only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly Jira integration is only for Jira Cloud product offerings. It does not work in Jira Data Center or Jira Server.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

When a feature flag is turned on or off or has its targeting rules updated, its associated Jira issue pages display the flag's current status.

## Prerequisites

To complete this procedure, you must have the following prerequisites:

- The LaunchDarkly for Jira app from the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1219142/launchdarkly-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) in your Jira Cloud instance.
- A personal or service API access token. To learn more, read [API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens).

## Set up the Jira integration

To set up the Jira integration, you must complete the following steps:

1. Give your API access token the required permissions:

- You can [create a custom role with webhook and flag link permissions, then add the custom role to a personal or service access token](#create-a-custom-role-and-add-it-to-an-api-access-token), or
- you can [add the built-in Writer role to your personal access token](#add-the-built-in-writer-role-to-your-personal-access-token).

2. [Configure the LaunchDarkly integration in Jira with the API access token](#configure-the-launchdarkly-integration-in-jira).

This allows LaunchDarkly to communicate with Jira any time you change a flag.

## Give your API access token the required permissions

You can create a custom role with appropriate permissions then add the custom role to a personal or service access token, or you can add the built-in Writer role to your personal access token.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>You may need to update your access token</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you configured the Jira integration prior to February 15, 2022, you may need to update your access token's custom role to include a statement allowing access to `proj/*:env/*:flag/*` resources with the `createFlagLink`, `updateFlagLink`, and `deleteFlagLink` actions.

### Create a custom role and add it to an API access token

<Details summary="Expand Create a custom role and add it to an API access token">

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>Service tokens and custom roles are Enterprise features</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Service tokens and custom roles are available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To create a custom role for the API access token:

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click into the **Roles** tab.
3. Click **Create role**. The "Create custom role" panel appears.
4. Give the custom role a human-readable name.
5. In the "Role policy" section, enter `webhook/*` in the **Choose resources for this policy statement** field.
6. Select "Allow" from the **Allow or deny actions on the resource** menu.
7. Choose `createWebhook` and `deleteWebhook` from the **Choose actions to allow or deny** menu.
8. Click **Update statement**.
9. Click **+ Add statement**.
10. In the "Role policy" section, enter `proj/*:env/*:flag/*` in the **Choose resources for this policy statement** field.
11. Select "Allow" from the **Allow or deny actions on the resource** menu.
12. Choose `createFlagLink`, `updateFlagLink`, and `deleteFlagLink` from the **Choose actions to allow or deny** menu.
13. Click **Update statement**.

The custom role is now configured.

Here is an image of a custom role configured to grant access to webhooks and flag links:

![An access token's custom role configured to grant access to webhooks and flag links.](jira-create-access-token.png)<br/>

You can also use the advanced role policy editor to grant permissions by adding this policy:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Jira policy">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["createWebhook", "deleteWebhook"],
    "resources": ["webhook/*"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["createFlagLink", "updateFlagLink", "deleteFlagLink"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*:flag/*"]
  }
]
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn more about custom role policies, read [Creating custom roles and policies](/home/members/role-create).

Next, add the custom role to the API token to grant the Jira integration additional permissions.

To add the custom role to the API token:

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click into the **Authorization** tab.
3. Find the API access token you want to add permissions to and select "Edit token" from its **overflow menu**. The "Edit" panel appears.
4. In the **Role** menu, select "Custom."
5. Check the checkbox next to the custom role you just created.
6. Click **Save token**.

The custom role is applied to the API token.

</Details>

### Add the built-in Writer role to your personal access token

<Details summary="Expand Add the built-in Writer role to your personal access token">

To add the built-in Writer role to a personal access token:

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click into the **Authorization** tab.
3. Find the personal access token you want to add permissions to and select "Edit token" from its **overflow menu**. The "Edit" panel appears.
4. In the **Role** menu, select "Writer."
5. Click **Save token**.

Your personal token now has the Writer role.

</Details>

## Configure the LaunchDarkly integration in Jira

Use your access token to configure the Jira integration for your LaunchDarkly account.

1. Navigate to your Jira instance's app management page, and click the **Configuration** button for the LaunchDarkly app. The "Configure LaunchDarkly Integration" screen appears.
2. Set your API access token.
3. Select which environment the app will track for each of your LaunchDarkly projects. By default, the app will track your production environments.

![The Jira configuration screen.](jira-configure-ld-integration.png)

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Environment selection</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If selected environments are reconfigured after issues have already been associated with flags, the existing connections display the environments they were historically connected to until the next time that flag is updated.

New flag connections display the flag configuration for the updated environment.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you have set up the LaunchDarkly for Jira app, a "Releases" panel appears when you view issues on your Jira board.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Enable the release panel</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Jira issue view, which contains the release panel, is a per-user setting. If it is off, the release panel does not appear. To learn more, read [Jira's documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-work-management/docs/what-is-the-new-jira-issue-view/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Now that the Jira app is configured, you can connect feature flags to Jira issues. If no flags are associated with an existing Jira issue, you can add one with a button. If you already have one or more flags associated with a Jira issue, the rollout status of each connected feature flag on each Jira issue appears.

## Creating a new feature flag from a Jira issue

To create a new flag with Jira issues:

1. Navigate to your Jira issue's feature flag panel.
2. In the "Details" section, click **Add feature flag**.
3. Select "Create feature flag".

![The "Releases" menu with the "Create feature flag" option called out.](jira-create-feature-flag-callout.png)

The LaunchDarkly "Create a feature flag" panel appears with the Jira issue pre-populated:

![The "Create a feature flag" panel.](jira-new-feature-flag.png)

4. Finish configuring your flag and click **Save flag**.

When you toggle the flag on or off or make any targeting rule changes, those changes will appear in your Jira issue.

## Connecting an existing feature flag to a Jira issue from LaunchDarkly

If you have already created a feature flag for your Jira issue, you can add a Jira issue to your existing flag by creating a [custom property](/home/connecting/custom-properties) for your flag.

1. Navigate to the flag's **Settings** page.
2. Name the custom property `Jira issues`.

![The flag's "Settings" page, configured with a "Jira issues" custom property.](jira-custom-properties-menu.png)

3. Enter a list of Jira issue keys as the property value. You can list multiple issues if applicable.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

![The Jira issues custom properties field.](jira-custom-properties-issues.png)

## Viewing a flag's status in a Jira issue

To view a flag's status in a Jira issue:

1. Navigate to your Jira issue's feature flag panel.
2. In the "Details" section, click on the name of the feature flag. A dialog with a **Feature flags** tab appears:

![The "Feature flags" tab of a Jira issue displaying the flag's information and status.](jira-issue-flag-status.png)

## Removing a feature flag from a Jira issue

To remove a flag from a Jira issue:

1. Navigate to the flag's **Settings** tab.
2. In the "Jira Issues" section, click the **X** on the Jira issue custom property you want to remove:
   ![The "Custom properties" section with with the "Delete custom property" option shown.](jira-delete-custom-properties.png)
3. Click **Save with comment**.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Adding issues to an existing flag</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Your Jira issue must exist before you associate it with your feature flag. If you accidentally added a Jira issue to your flag, delete the custom property, create your Jira issue, and try again.
