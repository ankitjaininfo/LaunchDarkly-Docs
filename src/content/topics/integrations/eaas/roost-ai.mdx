## Overview

This topic links to Roost.ai's documentation for its LaunchDarkly integration.

The Roost.ai testing platform automates test environment creation and lifecycle management. This helps avoid integration issues later in production, reduces change failure rates, and speeds up release cycles for cloud-native applications. The integration with LaunchDarkly syncs LaunchDarkly environments with Roost.ai environments.

Roost.ai manages this integration. To learn how to use it, read Roost.ai's [LaunchDarkly Integration](https://zbio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RFD/pages/1748500481/Roost+LaunchDarkly+Integration).
