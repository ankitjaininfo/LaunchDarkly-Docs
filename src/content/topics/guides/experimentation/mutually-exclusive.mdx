## Overview

This guide explains how to create mutually exclusive experiments. Mutually exclusive experiments are two or more experiments configured to prevent contexts from being included in more than one at a time.

Generally, it is not a problem to include a context in multiple experiments. Our Experimentation offering minimizes interaction effects using audience allocation, and you can be confident in the winning variation even when running multiple concurrent experiments with overlapping audiences.

However, there are some cases in which you may not want to include each context in more than one experiment at a time. For example, you may be concerned about collisions between experiments that are testing similar parts of your app, like two different changes to the same section of your app’s user interface (UI), or experiments running on both the back end and front end of the same functionality.

Ideally, you would run experiments with potential collisions sequentially or include all of the related changes in the same experiment. However, if you are unable to do that due to time or other constraints, you can create mutually exclusive experiments using prerequisite flags.

In this tutorial you will:

- Create a prerequisite flag
- Create two dependent flags
- Include each dependent flag in its own mutually exclusive experiment

### Controlling experiment audiences with flag variations

You can control experiment audiences with flag variations. First, you can create a prerequisite flag with variations that correspond to each of the mutually exclusive experiments you want to run. Then, you can use a percentage rollout to randomly assign each context to only one of those exclusive experiments.

If you want LaunchDarkly to include all of your contexts in one of the experiments, add the percentage rollout to the default rule in the prerequisite flag. If you want LaunchDarkly to include only some of your contexts in the experiments, add the percentage rollout to a targeting rule in the prerequisite flag.

In this example, the prerequisite flag uses a targeting rule to limit contexts in the experiments to only those on an iOS device:

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you must have the following prerequisites:

- An active LaunchDarkly account with Experimentation enabled, and with permissions to create flags and edit experiments.
- Familiarity with the Experimentation feature. To learn more, read [About Experimentation](/home/about-experimentation).

## Concepts

To complete this guide, you should understand the following concepts:

### Prerequisite flags

Prerequisites allow you to control feature dependencies in LaunchDarkly. You can configure feature flags to depend on other flags being enabled to take effect, making those other flags prerequisites to enable the feature. To learn more, read [Flag prerequisites](/home/flags/prerequisites).

## Creating the prerequisite flag

In this example, you will create a string prerequisite flag. You will assign 50% of contexts to the `Experiment 1` variation, and 50% of contexts to the `Experiment 2` variation. Later, when you create your two mutually exclusive experiments, the flags those experiments include will be dependents of this flag.

To create the prerequisite flag:

1. Navigate to the flags list.
2. Click **Create flag**. The "Create a feature flag" panel appears.
3. Enter "Mutually exclusive experiment prereq" in the **Name** field.
4. Enter a description such as "The prerequisite flag for two mutually exclusive experiments" in the **Description** field.
5. In the **Flag variations** menu, select "String."
6. Enter "Experiment 1" in the **Variation 1** field.
7. Enter "Experiment 2" in the **Variation 2** field.

8. Click **Save flag**. The flag’s **Targeting** tab appears.
9. In the "Default rule" **serve** menu, select "a percentage rollout."
  - (Optional) If you want to include only some of your contexts in the experiments, targeted by attribute, add the percentage rollout to a targeting rule instead of the default rule.
10. Update the rollout so 50% of contexts are served Experiment 1, and 50% of contexts are served Experiment 2.

11. Click **Review and save**.

Next, you will create your dependent flags.

## Creating dependent flags

Next, create the two dependent flags you will include in your two experiments.

To create the first dependent flag:

1. Navigate to the flags list.
2. Click **Create flag**. The "Create a feature flag" panel appears.
3. Enter "Mutually exclusive flag 1" in the **Name** field.
4. Enter a description such as "The dependent flag in mutually exclusive experiment #1" in the **Description** field.
5. Click **Save flag**. The flag’s **Targeting** tab appears.
6. Click **Add prerequisites**.
7. Choose "Mutually exclusive experiment prereq" from the **Select a flag** menu.
8. Leave the variation set to "Experiment 1."

9. Click **Review and save**.

To create the second dependent flag:

1. Navigate to the flags list.
2. Click **Create flag**. The "Create a feature flag" panel appears.
3. Enter "Mutually exclusive flag 2" in the **Name** field.
4. Enter a description such as "The dependent flag in mutually exclusive experiment #2" in the **Description** field.
5. Click **Save flag**. The flag’s **Targeting** tab appears.
6. Click **Add prerequisites**.
7. Choose "Mutually exclusive experiment prereq" from the **Select a flag** menu.
8. Change the variation to "Experiment 2."
9. Click **Review and save**.

You will now have three related flags in your flags list. Next, you will include the two dependent flags in two separate experiments.

## Creating experiments

Creating an experiment requires four steps:

1. Creating a metric
2. Building the experiment
3. Turning on the feature flag
4. Starting an iteration

### Creating your metrics

For this tutorial, you will create two custom conversion metrics, one for each of your experiments. To learn more, read [Custom conversion metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics/custom-conversion).

To create the first custom metric:

1. Navigate to the **Experiments** list.
2. Click the **Metrics** tab.
3. Click **Create metric**. The "Create a new metric" panel appears.
4. Enter "Experiment 1 custom metric" in the **Name** field.
5. Click the **Event kind** menu and select "Custom."
6. Enter "Experiment 1 metric" in the **Event name** field.
7. Choose the `user` context kind for the metric to measure events from.

![The "Event information" section of the "Create a new metric" panel with a conversion metric configured.](metrics-event-information.png)

8. Click **Save metric**.

To create the second custom metric, repeat steps 1-7, except name the metric "Experiment 2 custom metric" and name the event "Experiment 2 metric."

### Building your experiments

Now it’s time to build your two mutually exclusive experiments.

To build your first experiment:

1. Navigate to the **Experiments** list.
2. Click **Create experiment**:

![The "Experiments" list with the "Create experiment" button called out.](experiment-list-new-callout.png)

3. Enter "Mutually exclusive experiment 1" in the **Experiment name** field.
4. Enter a **Hypothesis** for your experiment.
5. Choose the `user` context kind as the randomization unit.
6. Click **Next**. The "Select metrics" step opens.
7. Choose "Experiment 1 custom metric" from the **Primary metric** menu.

![The "Select metrics" section of a new experiment.](mutually-exclusive-metric.png)

8. Click **Next**. The "Define variations" step opens.
9. Choose the "Mutually exclusive flag 1" flag from the **Select flag** menu.
10. Click **Next**. The "Set audience" step opens.
11. Enter the percentage of traffic for each variation you want to include in the experiment.
12. Select which variation you want LaunchDarkly to serve to the remaining population.

![The "Set audience" section of a new experiment.](mutually-exclusive-audience.png)

13. Click **Finish**. You are returned to the experiment's **Design** tab.

To create your second experiment, repeat steps 1-13, except choose "Experiment 2 custom metric" and "Mutually exclusive flag 2."

### Toggling on your flags

When you are ready to run your experiments, toggle your prerequisite flag and both dependent flags to **On**.

### Starting experiment iterations

The last step is to start an iteration for each of your mutually exclusive experiments.

To start your experiment iterations:

1. Navigate to the **Experiments** list.
2. Click on "Mutually exclusive experiment 1."
3. Click **Start**.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for "Mutually exclusive experiment 2."

You are now running two mutually exclusive experiments, with no overlap between the contexts included in each.

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to create a prerequisite flag and two dependent flags to prevent contexts from being included in two concurrent experiments.

Mutually exclusive experiments are not limited to two at a time. When it's time to create your own, you can create as many mutually exclusive experiments as you need to prevent collisions between experiments running on similar parts of your app or infrastructure.
