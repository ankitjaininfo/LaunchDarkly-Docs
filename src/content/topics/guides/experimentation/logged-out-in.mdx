## Overview

This guide provides strategies and best practices to manage experiments that include both logged-out and logged-in end users.

You may want to run experiments on end-user behavior within apps or websites that have both a logged-out and logged-in state, such as an online store where customers can check out either as a guest or as a logged-in user.

You could compare two variations of your site, a one-click checkout experience versus a two-click checkout experience, and track a metric such as time to check out. The most important thing for your experiment to measure is whether one click or two clicks affects the time customers spend checking out of your store, so the primary metric you will use is checkout time. If you want to also track whether or not the end user was logged in, you can add their logged-in state as a custom attribute. To learn more, read [Custom user attributes](/home/users/custom-attributes).

We don't recommend trying to use the SDK [aliasing](/sdk/features/aliasing-users) feature to serve the same variation to a user both before and after they log in.

Some of the problems with trying to use the aliasing feature for this purpose include:

- Inconsistency in end-user experience within a session, leading to confusion for the customer.
- There are some situations when it is not possible for LaunchDarkly to associate two different users using the alias method.
- The aliasing feature is deprecated in the newest versions of some of our SDKs, and will eventually no longer be available. To learn more, read [Aliasing users](/sdk/features/aliasing-users).

## Concepts

In order to use this guide, you should understand the following concepts:

### Logged-out users

Logged-out end users are users that LaunchDarkly has not yet identified. When you're using Experimentation with logged-out users, you should assign each logged-out user a unique key. To learn more, read [Tracking anonymous users with unique keys](/home/users/anonymous-users#tracking-anonymous-users-with-unique-keys).

### Custom user attributes

You can create custom user attributes to track and target users based on any data you want to track. To learn more, read [Custom user attributes](/home/users/custom-attributes).

### Custom numeric metrics

You can use numeric metrics to track the changes in a value against a baseline value. To learn more, read [Custom numeric metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics/custom-numeric).

## Consistency during end-user sessions

When conducting an experiment on an app or website with both logged-out and logged-in states, it feels intuitive to want the end user to receive the same variation every time they log in. However, if you prioritize giving the end user the same variation every time they log in, that end user might see a different variation before and after they log in within the same session. Having the variation change mid-session can be more confusing than seeing different variations between sessions.

For example, imagine Anna visits your website on her phone before she logs in. She sees variation A, the one-click checkout option. She adds some items to her cart, remembers to log in, continues to see variation A, adds a few more items, then gets interrupted. She decides to finish checking out later.

That evening, Anna visits your website from her laptop. Because she is not logged in yet and is on a different device, your experiment has no way to know she is the same person from earlier in the day. The experiment serves variation B, the two-click checkout option. Anna then logs in. If you insist on Anna's logged-in state always seeing variation A, that means Anna will suddenly see her variation change from B to A in the middle of her session. This is confusing to Anna, and she wonders if there is a bug in the checkout process. Anna decides not to enter her credit card information until she's sure there's not a problem with the site, and leaves the store without checking out.

Contrast this with Miguel's experience. Miguel visits your website on his phone and does not log in. He sees variation A, the one-click checkout option. He adds some items to his cart, remembers to log in, continues to see variation A, adds a few more items, then gets interrupted. He decides to finish checking out later.

That evening, Miguel visits your website from his laptop. Because he is not logged in yet, and is on a different device, your experiment has no way to know he is the same person from earlier in the day. The experiment serves variation B, the two-click checkout option. Miguel then logs in and looks at his cart. Miguel continues to see variation B, experiences no interruption in user experience, and completes his transaction.

In either scenario, if your metric is tracking time to check out, it will properly track the end user's behavior and correlate it to the correct variation. This is because the experiment is comparing checkout buttons, not logged-in states. However, Miguel had a better user experience than Anna. 

The approach you choose when designing experiments for logged-out and logged-in users should balance your experiment's objectives and the end user's experience. For the above example, one way you could ensure a more consistent user experience is to limit the experiment to mobile-only or desktop-only, or to run two mutually exclusive concurrent experiments, one for each platform. To learn how, read [Creating mutually exclusive experiments](/guides/experimentation/mutually-exclusive).

## Build an experiment with logged-out and logged-in states

Even when you design your experiment for consistency within sessions, you can still track whether an end user was logged in using a custom attribute. In this example, we will show you how to build a checkout experience experiment for an app with logged-out and logged-in states, and how to track time to checkout as a primary metric.

### Hypothesis

To begin, create a hypothesis for your experiment.

Here is an example:

"We believe that customers who encounter a one-click checkout experience will spend less time in the checkout process than customers who encounter a two-click checkout experience."

### Sample size

Next, determine the sample size needed for your experiment. In this example, you know that about 2000 customers check out per day, and you'd like to have at least 15,000 customers in your experiment. So, you will run this experiment on 50% of your customer base for 15 days to include about 15,000 customers.

Here is the sample size calculation:

`2000 customers x 15 days x 50% of customers = 15,000 users in experiment`

### Metric

Use a custom numeric metric to track time to checkout. To learn how to create a custom numeric metric, read [Custom numeric metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics/custom-numeric).

Here is an example of this metric:

![The "Metric information" panel for a custom numeric metric.](experiment-logged-in-metric.png)

When adding the event name in your codebase, use the same event name that you created as part of your metric. In this example, the event name is "Time to checkout."

### Variations

The boolean flag you use in your experiment will have two variations:

- A two-click checkout, which acts as the control
- A one-click checkout

Here is what your flag's **Variations** tab will look like:

![A flag's "Variations" tab with two variations.](experiment-logged-in-flag.png)

### Audience

In this experiment, you want a random sample of your entire user base in the experiment, so you will not create any targeting rules for the flag.

### Experiment design

Finally, combine your hypothesis, metric, flag, and audience into an experiment. To learn how, read [Building experiments](/home/creating-experiments#building-experiments).

Here is an example of the finished experiment in LaunchDarkly:

## Conclusion

When running experiments on sites with logged-out and logged-in states, you do not need to serve the same variation to a particular end user every time they log in. Instead, maintaining a consistent experience before and after log in throughout a single session is a better user experience, and ensures that you still record the Experimentation data you need to make improvements to your site.
