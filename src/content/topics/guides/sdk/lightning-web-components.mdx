## Overview

This guide explains how to configure your Salesforce environment to use the LaunchDarkly JavaScript or React Web client-side SDKs in Lightning Web Components (LWCs).

Salesforce Lightning Web Components are an implementation of standard web components that allow you to leverage HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a lightweight framework. To learn more, read [Introducing Lightning Web Components](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc).

The example code in this guide is extracted snippets. We show it here as if it is being used in a JavaScript class.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you must have the following prerequisites:

* Basic working knowledge of the LaunchDarkly [JavaScript client-side SDK](/sdk/client-side/javascript) or [React Web client-side SDK](/sdk/client-side/react/react-web)
* Basic working knowledge of [Salesforce Lightning Web Components](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc)

## Download the LaunchDarkly JavaScript Client

To begin, find the latest version under [Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client-sdk/releases) in the JavaScript SDK GitHub repository. Then download the desired version from `https://unpkg.com/launchdarkly-js-client-sdk@<VERSION>/dist/ldclient.min.js`.

## Set up your Salesforce environment

Next, set up your Salesforce environment. To do this:

1. Upload the file to your Salesforce organization as a static resource in your org
2. [Enable Lightning Web Security](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.security_lwsec_enable) in your org
3. Add `https://*.launchdarkly.com` as a CSP Trusted Site, under [Manage CSP Trusted Sites](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.csp_trusted_sites.htm&type=5)

## Using the LaunchDarkly client in a Lightning Web Component

In the JavaScript file of your Lightning Web Component, import the static resource:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Import LD client">

```js
import ldclient from '@salesforce/resourceUrl/ldclient';

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Then, load the imported script for usage in the file, using the Lightning Web Component [Platform Resource Loader](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-platform-resource-loader/documentation):

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Load script">

```js
Promise.all([
	loadScript(this, ldclient)
])
.then(() => {
// Post Script Load Code Here
})

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Finally, initialize the LaunchDarkly client:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Initializing LaunchDarkly client">

```js
const context = {
  kind: 'user',
  key: 'context-key-123abc'
};
this.LDClient = ldclient.initialize('client-side-id-123abc', context);

await this.LDClient.waitUntilReady();

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can access the flag value using a JavaScript `getter` method:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Example flag getter method">

```js
get exampleFlag() {
    return await this.LDClient.variation['example-flag', false];
}


```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn more, read [LWC Data Binding](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.js_props_getter)
You can then use HTML to allow feature flags to control your user interface (UI) display.

Here is an example of an LWC HTML snippet:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="LWC HTML snippet">

```html
<template if:true={exampleFlag}>
     Flag evaluation is TRUE
</template>
<template if:false={exampleFlag}>
     Flag evaluation is FALSE
</template>

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Conclusion

In this guide, we discussed how to use the LaunchDarkly JavaScript and React Web client-side SDKs in Lightning Web Components. This allows you to leverage HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a lightweight framework.
