# Best practices and gotchas

Translating markdown and HTML components into human-usable formatting can be scary. Follow these best practices to have a better experience:

* Line breaks to separate HTML-style tags in React components from other types of content. For example:
```
  <Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>CALLOUT-TITLE</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

CALLOUT CONTENT.

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>
```

* Left-justify text content inside callouts

  As pictured above. Callout contents do not respect markdown unless they are left-justified.

* Line breaks after every component

  Separate headers, components, and other formatting with a paragraph break. This ensures the text formats correctly. Don't worry about inline links, those don't mess up any formatting.

```
# EXAMPLE HEADER
< -- this line deliberately left blank -- >
Content content.
```

## Formatting callouts

You can put code samples and markdown into callouts in one of two ways.

Use a code block:

```
<CalloutTitle><code>more_code</code></CalloutTitle>
```

Or insert blank lines above and below where you want to use the markdown:

```
<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>

`more_code`

  </CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

`even_more_code`

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>
```

### Different types of callouts

There are four different types of callouts:

```
<Callout intent="info"> (blue)

<Callout intent="warning"> (yellow)

<Callout intent="alert"> (red)

<Callout intent="primary"> (light blue)
```

# Components

## Learn more

Use the LearnMore component to link to related API endpoints in our API docs.

<LearnMore>

You can also use the REST API: [Single link](/foobar)

</LearnMore>

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Single learn more">

```js
<LearnMore>

You can also use the REST API: [Single link](/foobar)

</LearnMore>
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Details

The docs site supports a details or "disclosure" component to expand/collapse information.

<Details summary="Click to open more information">

Here are some expanded details

</Details>

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Details">

```jsx
<Details summary="Click to open more information">

Here are some expanded details

</Details>
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Details may also be set to be open by default

<Details open summary="Click to open more information">

This details is open by default

</Details>

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Details">

```jsx
<Details open summary="Click to open more information">

This details is open by default

</Details>
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Image

The docs site supports PNGs and GIFs. Just use Markdown images. Put the images in `/src/content/images`. In your Markdown, the path to the image is relative to that directory.

![Some caption](data-export.png)


<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Image">

```markdown
![Some caption](data-export.png)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Callout

Include a blank line between the opening and closing `<CalloutDescription>` tags and the content. Do not indent any lines.

```js
<Callout intent="primary"> <!-- OR alert, warning, info -->
  <CalloutTitle>This feature is for Early Access Program customers only</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

FEATURE HERE is only available to members of LaunchDarkly's Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access to this feature, [join the EAP](https://launchdarkly.com/eap).

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>
```

Optionally, you can include a `site` parameter in the initial callout tag:

```js
<Callout intent="primary" site="federal">
```

The behavior is as follows:

* If there is no `site` parameter, the callout is visible in both "LaunchDarkly docs" and "Federal docs"
* If `site="launchDarkly"`, the callout is only visible for "LaunchDarkly docs"
* If `site="federal"`, the callout is only visible for "Federal docs"

## Code samples

1. Write code block as markdown as usual.
2. Add a `CodeSample` component.
3. Each CSTab will be one of the tabs.
4. If a tab has federal-specific content, include two versions of the language. Set `site=federal` after the language for the federal-specific code block. When the reader selects "LaunchDarkly docs," the CSTab displays the unannotated code block. When they select "Federal docs," the CSTab displays the `site=federal` code block.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Code snippet">

```js
<CodeSample>
    <CSTab label="JavaScript">

    ```js
    function helloWorld() {
      console.log('Hello, world!');
    }
    ```
    ```js site=federal
      function helloFederal() {
        console.log('Hello, federal!');
      }
    ```

    </CSTab>
    <CSTab label="Python">

    ```python
    def hello_world():
      print 'Hello, world!'
    ```

    </CSTab>
    <CSTab label="Java">

    ```java
    class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
      }
    }
    ```

    </CSTab>

</CodeSample>
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

## Tables

Markdown tables are hard to read in text editors and easy to break. We built our own table component to use instead. It's much like an HTML table. When content in a table cell is left-justified, and bracketed by empty lines, you can use HTML tags in it.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Table">

```jsx
<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Name of column 1</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Name of column 2</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Column 1 Cell 1</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Column 1 Cell 2</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>

Column 2 Cell 1 <a href="example.com">with a link in it</a>.

      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>Column 2 Cell 2</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

# Special considerations for federal docs

Readers of [https://docs.launchdarkly.com/](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/) can select whether to view "LaunchDarkly docs" (default) or "Federal docs."

When viewing the federal docs:

* Select LaunchDarkly URLs in links and code samples automatically change from `.com` to `.us`. The list of these subdomains is maintained in `/src/utils/siteAwareUtils.ts`. However, any links authored as `.us` do NOT automatically change to `.com`.
* Alerts specific to readers of the federal docs may appear. You can specify these using the ["site" frontmatter keyword](/contributors-guide.md#writing-frontmatter-for-docs-topics).
* Callouts specific to readers of the federal docs may appear. You can specify these using the ["site" keyword in the callout tag](#callout).
* Code samples specific to readers of the federal docs may appear. You specify these using the ["site" keyword after the language](#code-samples).
