/**
 * This file is a workaround for a bug in gatsby-plugin-mdx and hot reloading.
 * Pages are created the first time you run gatsby via yarn start. If you make a change to an mdx file,
 * it does not get updated in the browser. This is because the mdx files are not within webpack's watch path until
 * a change is made to the pages parent layout component.
 * This script, which now runs along with yarn start, waits for the dev server to start,
 * then does a copy-in-place of the layout file to trigger the watch.
 * From then on, changes to mdx files will be reflected in the browser.
 * This script is only needed in development mode.
