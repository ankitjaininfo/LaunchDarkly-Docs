<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Contexts are for Early Access Program customers only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of describing and referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product.

Creating contexts and evaluating flags based on contexts is the primary feature in the LANGUAGE-NAME SDK Y.0 release. However, the ability to target flags or segments by context, or review context instances that have encountered flags in your application, is only available to members of LaunchDarkly's Early Access Program (EAP). To learn more or join the EAP, read [Contexts](/home/contexts).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Overview

This topic explains the changes in the LANGUAGE-NAME SDK Y.0 release and how to adapt code that uses a X.x version of the [SDK NAME](/LINK/TO/REFERENCE/GUIDE) to use version Y.0 or later.

**Version Y.0 includes several breaking changes**. Additionally, if you use the Relay Proxy, you must update your Relay Proxy to version 7.0 before you update your SDK to version Y.0. To learn more, read the [Relay Proxy 7.0 release notes](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/releases/tag/v7.0.0).

<!-- Only include the rest of this sub-section if applicable -->

Before you migrate to version Y.0, update to the latest X.x version. Some of the changes that are mandatory in Y.0 were originally added in a X.x version and made optional.

If you update to the latest X.x version, deprecation warnings appear in areas of your code that need to be changed for Y.0. You can update them at your own pace while still using X.x, rather than migrating everything simultaneously. To learn more about updating to the latest X.x version, visit the [SDK's GitHub repository](/LINK/TO/REPO).

## Identifying supported LANGUAGE-NAME versions for the Y.0 SDK

<!-- Include this section if a language version update is also required, for example, if you now need Go version 1.16 -->

The minimum LANGUAGE-NAME version for LaunchDarkly Y.0 SDK is VERSION.

LaunchDarkly no longer supports earlier LANGUAGE-NAME versions, as stated in the [End of Life policy](https://launchdarkly.com/policies/end-of-life-policy/).

## Understanding contexts

Many LaunchDarkly customers create targeting rules for feature flags based on a variety of different information, including attributes pertaining to users, organizations, devices, and more. In previous versions of the LaunchDarkly SDK, you could define this information in a user object, using a combination of built-in and custom attributes. Now you can define this information in a more structured way, using **contexts**.

Each context has a required attribute called `kind` that describes the type of attributes it contains. You can also add other attributes. Attributes can be strings, booleans, numbers, arrays, or JSON objects.

When you evaluate a feature flag within your application, the flag's targeting rules use information from one or more kinds of contexts. For example, you may know:

  * the username, first name, last name, and email address of a person, as part of a context with `kind` of "user"
  * the organization, department, and location of a person, as part of a context with `kind` of "organization"
  * the device, model, and operating system of an environment, as part of a context with `kind` of "device"

This new version of the LaunchDarkly SDK requires you to evaluate feature flags using an **evaluation context**, which is an object containing one or more contexts.

To learn more about contexts, read [Contexts](/home/contexts).

## Migrating from users to contexts

The Y.0 version of this SDK lets you use contexts. <!-- Make sure to update the type names in this paragraph as applicable. --> <!-- Use this version if LDUser is NOT being automatically converted behind the scenes --> When you migrate from version X.x, you must replace every instance of a user with a context. For the Y.0 version of the LANGUAGE-NAME SDK, this means changing each use of `LDUser` to `LDContext`. <!-- Use this version if LDUser is being converted behind the scenes --> When you migrate from version X.x, replace every instance of a user with a context. If there are any instances you do not replace, the Y.0 version of the LANGUAGE-NAME SDK will convert each `LDUser` parameter it receives to `LDContext` and call the `LDContext`-specific version of the method.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly assumes older versions of the SDK use <code>user</code> contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context always has a `kind` attribute. When older versions of the LANGUAGE-NAME SDK send events to LaunchDarkly, LaunchDarkly will convert the users in those events to contexts with a `kind` of `user`.

If a flag configuration specifies any context `kind`s other than `user`, older versions of the LANGUAGE-NAME SDK will not evaluate the flag correctly. You must upgrade your SDK if you are going to use context `kind`s other than `user` in your flag configurations.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The primary differences between working with users and working with contexts include the following:

* [Changes to flag evaluation](#understanding-changes-to-flag-evaluation): The methods for evaluating flags now require contexts, rather than users. <!-- Only include this item for server-side SDKs -->
* [Create contexts, not users](#understanding-differences-between-users-and-contexts): Where you previously created users, now you can create contexts.
* [Changes to attributes](#understanding-changes-to-built-in-and-custom-attributes): There are now fewer built-in attributes. You can still add as many custom attributes as you like, although the format has changed slightly. A flag's targeting rules can now address fields within a JSON object.
* [Changes to private attributes](#understanding-changes-to-private-attributes): You can mark specific attributes of a context as private, either across all contexts of any kind, or within a particular context or context kind.
* [Changes to automatic attribute population](#understanding-changes-to-automatic-custom-property-population): The SDK no longer automatically populates the "device" and "os" properties. <!-- Only include this item for Android and iOS SDKs -->
* [Changes to anonymous users](#understanding-changes-to-anonymous-users): Client-side SDKs no longer automatically populate the device ID. <!-- Only include this item for client-side SDKs -->
* [Changes to alias events](#understanding-changes-to-alias-events): The alias method has been removed.

### Understanding changes to flag evaluation

<!-- Only include this section for server-side SDKs. For client-side SDKs, the evaluation isn't changing -->

The methods for [evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating) and determining [flag evaluation reasons](/sdk/features/evaluation-reasons) have changed slightly. The Y.0 version of the SDK includes the following changes:

<!-- Update the method names in this section as needed. Add any additional changes specific to this SDK to the end of the list. -->

  * The `variation` and `variationDetail` methods now take a context, rather than a user, as a parameter. To learn more, read [TKTK](/LINK/TO/SDK/API/DOCS) and [TKTK](/LINK/TO/SDK/API/DOCS).
  * The `USER_NOT_SPECIFIED` evaluation error code was previously defined as, the user object or user key was not provided. It has been redefined to mean that the context was not provided or was invalid.

Here's how to evaluate a flag using a context:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="variation"
  values={[
    { label: 'Y.0 syntax', value: 'variation', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="variation">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example call to variation, e.g.
boolean value = client.boolVariation('flag-key-123abc', context, false);
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Understanding differences between users and contexts

Where you previously created users, now you can create contexts.

Here's how to construct a basic context, as compared with constructing a user:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="user"
  values={[
    { label: 'X.x syntax, user with key', value: 'user', },
    { label: 'Y.0 syntax, context with key', value: 'single-context', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="user">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example building a user in the previous version of the SDK, with just a key
```
</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="single-context">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example building a single context, with a "kind" of "user" and a key
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<!-- Include the following callout only for JavaScript-based SDKs (JS Client, Vue, React, Node Server, Node Client, Electron) -->

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Omitting the <code>kind</code> creates a user object, not a context</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you omit the `kind` attribute when you create a context, then LaunchDarkly will assume the context kind is "user" when evaluating flags. Additionally, the SDK will assume you are working with a user object, rather than a context.

Overall, this should make your upgrade easier, because your existing code will continue to work, as long as you don't make changes to your flag configuration or [bucket users based on the "secondary" attribute](#removing-the-secondary-attribute).

However, if you are using version Y.0 of the SDK and you are omitting the `kind` attribute, then the following caveats apply:

<ul>
<li>The fields in your user object must be <code>LDUser</code> fields, not <code>LDContext</code> fields. For example, to mark an attribute as private, you must use <code>privateAttributeNames</code> in the user object, not <code>_meta.privateAttributes</code> as you would for a context object. To learn more, read <a href="#understanding-changes-to-private-attributes">Understanding changes to private attributes</a>.</li>
<li>Any additional attributes in your user object need to be inside the <code>custom</code> property of the <code>LDUser</code>, not at the top-level as they would in a context object. To learn more, read <a href="#working-with-built-in-and-custom-attributes">Working with built-in and custom attributes</a>.</li>
</ul>

We strongly recommend upgrading your SDK to take advantage of the context functionality.
</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here's how to construct a basic context, with a context kind of something other than "user":

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="single-context"
  values={[
    { label: 'Y.0 syntax, single context with key', value: 'single-context', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="single-context">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example building a single context, with a "kind" of "organization" and a key
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Here's how to construct a multi-context, which includes multiple context kinds:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="multi-context"
  values={[
    { label: 'Y.0 syntax, multi-context', value: 'multi-context', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="multi-context">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example building a multi-context; one context can have a "kind" of user, the other can have a "kind" of device
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Understanding changes to built-in and custom attributes

This section describes the changes to built-in and custom attributes in the Y.0 version of the SDK.

#### Working with built-in and custom attributes
----
<br/>

In previous SDK versions, the user object included several built-in attributes for describing the user. It also included optional custom attributes, which you could add to a `custom` object within the user object and then populate.

In version Y.0, the only built-in attributes are `kind`, `key`, `name`, and `anonymous`. `Kind`, `key`, and `name` are strings, and `anonymous` is a boolean.

You can define additional attributes for a context by passing in a name and value for each. Additional attributes can be any JSON type, including boolean, number, string, array, or object.

Here's how to construct a context with additional attributes, as compared with constructing a similar user:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="user"
  values={[
    { label: 'X.x syntax, user with attributes', value: 'user', },
    { label: 'Y.0 syntax, context with attributes', value: 'context', },

  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="user">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example building a user in the previous version of the SDK, with a key, name, and email
```
</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="context">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example building a single context, with a "kind" of "user" and a key, name, and email
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Referencing properties of an attribute object
----
<br/>

In previous versions of the SDK, if you set the value of a user's custom attribute to an object, you could not reference that object in evaluations. In version Y.0, if a context attribute's value is a JSON object, you can reference properties of that object as the attribute in the targeting rules for a flag or segment.

Here's how to add object attributes to a context:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="context"
  values={[
    { label: 'Y.0 syntax, context with object attributes', value: 'context', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="context">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example of constructing a context with:
  - an attribute that is the JSON object `"address": { "street": "Main St", "city": "Springfield" }`
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

In your flag or segment targeting, use `/` as the delimiter to refer to specific object fields. For example, you can use `/address/city` in your targeting. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

#### Removing the secondary attribute
----
<br/>

<!-- update this section with the correct attribute or method name for "secondary" -->

In previous versions of the SDK, you could set the value of a user's `secondary` attribute, as an optional secondary key for a user. The SDK would incorporate this attribute into the variation bucket assignment hash.

In version Y.0, the `secondary` attribute has been removed. If you were previously using this attribute as part of distinguishing [percentage rollouts](/home/flags/rollouts#understanding-percentage-rollout-logic), that will no longer work for your users.

### Understanding changes to private attributes

As in previous versions of the SDK, you can mark specific attributes of a context as private. This restricts the context data your application sends to LaunchDarkly, while still using that data for flag targeting.

In version Y.0, there are two scopes for which you can mark attributes as private:

  * Across all contexts of any context kind. You might use this if you want to ensure that the SDK never sends an "email" attribute to LaunchDarkly, no matter whether it occurs in a user context, an organization context, or something else.
  * Within a particular context or context kind. You might use this if you want an "email" attribute to be private in a user context, but not in an organization context.

  In the first example, all attributes are marked private for all contexts. Only the context key and kind are sent to LaunchDarkly. In the second example, the "email" and "address" attributes are private for all contexts:

  <CodeTabs
    defaultValue="private-all"
    values={[
      { label: 'Y.0 syntax, all attributes marked private', value: 'private-all', },
      { label: 'Y.0 syntax, two attributes marked private', value: 'private-some', },
    ]
  }>
  <CodeTabItem value="private-all">

  ```LANGUAGE-NAME
  TKTK - example setting the the `allAttributesPrivate` SDK configuration option.
  ```
  </CodeTabItem>
  <CodeTabItem value="private-some">

  ```LANGUAGE-NAME
  TKTK - example setting the `privateAttributes` SDK configuration option for "email" and "address".
  ```
  </CodeTabItem>
  </CodeTabs>

To learn more, read [TKTK](/LINK/TO/SDK/API/DOCS).

Here's how to mark an attribute as private for a particular context:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="private"
  values={[
    { label: 'Y.0 syntax, attribute marked private for one context', value: 'private', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="private">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example setting the `privateAttributes` `_meta` attribute.
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

For attributes that are objects, you can mark specific fields private, using the `/` delimiter followed by the attribute name, then the `/` delimiter followed by the JSON property within the value.

For example, for the attribute `"address": { "street": "Main St", "city": "Springfield" }`, you could set just the `/address/street` as private.

<!-- Make sure the attribute names here are correct for this SDK -->

The `privateAttributeNames` attribute that existed in a user object in version X.x has been renamed to `privateAttributes` in version Y.0. It has moved from the top level of a user object into the `_meta` object within a context. To learn more, read [TKTK](/LINK/TO/SDK/API/DOCS).

<!-- The above paragraph is relevant for SDKs that do not have a context builder, where they actually have to write out what the context would look like in JSON. That's true for instance of the Node SDK, but not Go, Java, .NET, or Ruby (Ruby does not currently have a user builder, but it will have a context builder). -->

### Understanding changes to automatic custom property population

<!-- This section should only be included for Android and iOS SDKs, per https://launchdarkly.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/1561035770/Users+to+Contexts+tech+spec+-+data+model+API+protocols+and+SDKs#Auto-populated-attributes-in-mobile-SDKs -->

In the X.x version, the SDK automatically populated the `device` and `os` built-in attributes of a user. In version Y.0, the SDK will not automatically create or populate these attributes for contexts.

If you currently have feature flags that target these attributes, you will need to determine what context you want them to be part of, and populate them yourself.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="device"
  values={[
    { label: 'Y.0 syntax, setting device and OS', value: 'device', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="device">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example setting the `device` and `os` properties of a context with `kind` of `device`
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Understanding changes to anonymous users

<!-- only include this section for client-side SDKs -->

In X.x versions of the SDK, you could omit the user key when building an anonymous user. On mobile devices, the SDK set the user key to the device ID. On non-mobile platforms, the SDK set the user key to a generated UUID.

In the Y.0 version of the SDK, the SDK sets the context `key` for each context kind to a generated UUID for all platforms and devices.

If you currently have feature flags that target the device ID, you will need to determine what context you want the device ID to be part of, and populate the device ID attribute yourself.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="deviceid"
  values={[
    { label: 'Y.0 syntax, setting the device ID', value: 'deviceid', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="deviceid">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example setting the `deviceID` attribute of a context that has a `kind` of `device`
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Understanding changes to alias events

In previous versions of the SDK, multiple user objects could represent one person. For example, this could happen the first time a person logged in to your application. The person might be represented by an anonymous user before they logged in, and a different user after they logged in. You could associate these two LaunchDarkly users by sending an `alias` event in the SDK.

With the introduction of contexts, the person in this scenario is represented by two different context kinds. For example, before they log in, they might be represented by a device context. After they log in, they might be represented by a multi-context, for example, by one context kind based on their device and simultaneously by another context kind based on their user information.

The Y.0 version of the SDK removes the ability to send an `alias` event. If you currently [alias users](/sdk/features/aliasing-users), you will need to remove this code when you migrate to version Y.0.

If you want to continue associating two contexts with each other, you can use two different context kinds, and then identify a multi-context that includes both individual contexts when you want the association to occur.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="multi-context"
  values={[
    { label: 'Y.0 syntax, associating two contexts', value: 'multi-context', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="multi-context">

```LANGUAGE-NAME
TKTK - example defining two different context kinds (device, user), and then calling identify with a multi-context with both individual contexts
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more, read [TKTK](/LINK/TO/SDK/API/DOCS).

## Understanding changes to configuration options

<!--  Make sure to update the option names in this section as needed. Delete anything that's not applicable. -->

In the Y.0 version of the SDK, several configuration options have changed:

  * The `privateAttributes` and `allAttributesPrivate` configuration options both now apply to all contexts of any context kind. To learn more, read [Understanding changes to private attributes](#understanding-changes-to-private-attributes).
  * `privateAttributeNames` is now called `privateAttributes`. To learn more, read [Understanding changes to private attributes](#understanding-changes-to-private-attributes).
  * The `autoAliasingOptOut` option has been removed.<!-- this is applicable only to client-side SDKs-->
  * The `inlineUsersInEvents` option has been removed.
  * The `userKeysCapacity` and `userKeysFlushInterval` options are now deprecated. They have been replaced in this version with `contextKeysCapacity` and `contextKeysFlushInterval`, respectively. If both are provided, the newer context configuration options will take precedence.

To learn more, read [TKTK](/LINK/TO/SDK/API/DOCS).

## Understanding what was deprecated

<!-- Only include this section if relevant -->

All types and methods that were marked as deprecated in the last X.x release have been removed from the Y.0 release. If you were using these with a recent version previously, you should already have received deprecation warnings at compile time, with suggestions about their recommended replacements.

For a full list of deprecated types and methods, read [TKTK](/LINK/TO/SDK/API/DEPRECATION/LIST).
