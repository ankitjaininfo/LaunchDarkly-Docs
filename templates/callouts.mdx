<!--

This template collects some of the standard [callouts](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-docs-private/blob/main/src/content/topics/components.mdx#callout) that we use throughout the LaunchDarkly documentation. You can copy callouts from here rather than searching the entire project for an example.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The "site=launchDarkly" parameter means that the callout only appears when the "LaunchDarkly docs" version of the docs is selected. Trials are not available for federal customers, so this should not display when the "Federal docs" version of the docs is selected.

If a feature is part of EAP, use:

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>This feature is for Early Access Program customers only</CalloutTitle>

## Other common callouts

A few other callouts are used multiple times across the documentation.

### Making feature flags available

The "Making feature flags available to this SDK" callout is used in several of the SDK docs. There are two versions: one for client-side SDKs and one for mobile SDKs. While we don't always differentiate between these in our documentation, on the specific SDK pages we need to, so that we can identify the correct checkboxes for the reader.

Use this version for CLIENT-SIDE SDKs:

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the evaluation will fail. The SDK will serve the fallback value, specified in the evaluation call, for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's **Settings** tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Use this version for MOBILE SDKs:

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to mobile SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the evaluation will fail. The SDK will serve the fallback value, specified in the evaluation call, for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's **Settings** tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>


### Deprecation

This callout is currently only used on the New Relic legacy page.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Deprecation notice</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

We have deprecated FEATURE HERE and will no longer be updating it. Support for FEATURE HERE was removed in the X.Y release of the LANGUAGE HERE SDK. You can use this version of FEATURE HERE with the LANGUAGE HERE SDK in versions before X.Y. To learn more about the LANGUAGE HERE SDK, read [LANGUAGE HERE SDK reference](link).
